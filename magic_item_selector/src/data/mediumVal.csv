Volatile Vaporizer (1st),"This lime green pill is inedible but turns a potion into a cloud of mist that can be shared by multiple creatures. When placed inside a potion flask, the potion bubbles and froths itself into a pungent 10-foot-radius cloud. Any creature within the cloud when it appears gains the full effect of the potion. The cloud has no effect on creatures that cannot breathe. A creature may automatically resist the effects of the potion cloud by momentarily holding its breath. Using the pill destroys it and the potion. Each pill can only be used on potions of a particular spell level; using it on a potion of a different spell level has no effect (neither the potion nor the pill are consumed). The vaporizer also works on alchemist infusions, but not mutagens, extracts, or magical oils.","2,200 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/volatile-vaporizer
Knight's Pennon (Honor),"This narrow cloth flag is made to attach to the end a knight's lance, though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or even a staff. It has no effect if not mounted appropriately.

Bones of the Founder,"The bones of the Founder are small, blackened bone fragments, most no more than an inch long, and that radiate a faint, soothing warmth. Each bone grants the bearer 1 temporary hit point. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from possessing multiple bones, but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points return daily at dawn. There are a total of 32 bones that bear the power of the Founder. In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of the Founder within 50 feet. The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a bone of the Founder, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of bones of the Founder in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of the Founder that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 bones ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release the Founder’s soul to the afterlife, losing all power.","2,250 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bones-of-founder-raccona
"Crystal, Rhombocrystal","This jewel-like lens slowly changes colors over time. Most owners set it in a metal fixture on a chain and carry it as a pendant, monocle, or loupe. It acts as a magnifying glass and gives you a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks involving gems and crystals. If Nivi Rhombodazzle is your patron you gain a +1 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws.","2,250 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crystal-rhombocrystal
Kapre Cigars,"These thick cigars are made using a recipe so secret (and so potent) that neither tobacconist nor alchemist can identify the ingredients. Even in the chaos of combat their enormous cigars never fall from their mouths; their thick-skinned stogies interfere with their speech, lending a lazy drawl to their creaky voices. These 2-foot-long cigars never go out. They burn with a glow that sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the cigar is dangerous for any but a kapre—and not just because of its size. Only a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours. Once inhaled, the smoke can be exhaled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action. Creatures caught in the smoky cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.","2,250 ",7,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/kapre-cigars
Elixir of Sex Shifting,"Upon drinking this elixir, a character permanently transforms their biology to take on a different set of sexual characteristics of their choice. While the imbiber's physiology changes dramatically and their features adjust slightly to take on the new qualities, the imbiber is still recognizable as the same person. The character has only minor control over the specific details of this new appearance, and the elixir grants no benefit on Disguise skill checks or similar checks. This elixir's magic functions instantaneously and can't be dispelled, though drinking a second elixir of sex shift either reverts the character back to a former form or allows them to adopt alternate sexual characteristics, as they choose. The elixir has no effect on characters who are pregnant or are of races with no sexual differentiation. Most races have a wide spectrum of sexual differentiation, some common, others more rare. Therefore, most creatures can decide how this elixir transforms them. An unwilling imbiber can choose not to change at all.","2,250 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-of-sex-shifting
"Gem, Elemental","An elemental gem comes in one of four different varieties. Each contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water). When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a summon nature's ally spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem. The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. Air elemental gems are transparent, earth elemental gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange, and water elemental gems are blue-green.","2,250 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-elemental
"Ointment, Flying Ointment","This preparation of herbs includes belladonna, mandrake, and foxglove (also known as “witch's glove”) in a base of rendered fats.

Paralyzing Snare,"Once the command word is spoken, this 5-foot-diameter loop of wire blends with its surroundings. To find it, a character with the trapfinding ability must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check. Setting the snare is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Any creature that steps into the snare must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become magically paralyzed, as the spell hold monster. This effect can be ended by uttering the command word, succeeding at a DC 30 Disable Device check, or succeeding at the Will save. The snare is destroyed when the effect ends.","2,250 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/paralyzing-snare
Robe of the Master of Masters,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This brightly colored robe is made of fine silk. As a full-round action, the wearer can shift the original hue of the garment slightly (from red to pink or crimson, from blue to cyan or sapphire, and so on) or return it to its original color; the robe instantly reverts to its original color if the wearer removes the robe. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Perform (dance) checks. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, once per day as a free action the wearer can touch a tiny button on the wrist of the robe, granting her the effects of haste for 1 round. Once per day, the wearer can also perform a healing dance that lasts 5 minutes. When she does so, up to 7 allies within 30 feet heal 1 hit point.","2,300 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-the-master-of-masters
Ashes of Unluck,"These fine, gray ashes usually come in a black leather bag covered in various symbols of bad luck. When the contents of the bag are flung into the air, the ashes coat creatures within a 10-foot radius of the user, causing them to take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 2d4 rounds. The user is immune to this effect.","2,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/ashes-of-unluck
Boots of Friendly Terrain,"Boots of friendly terrain turn inhospitable territory into a perfect hunting grounds for any ranger who wears them, so much so that his footprints vanish behind him with each step he takes. Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific sort of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain class feature (jungle, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains, granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment as one of his favored terrains, that terrain’s bonus increases by 2.","2,400 ",5,Faint,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRD22fzR7W3kYOmax7QWeMeNcfRZVgyxMyJOu62pYho/edit#gid=484815266
Cloak of the Jungle,"When this plain green cloak is worn with the hood drawn up around the head, the wearer can assume the form of a Large tree or shrub, as per the tree shape spell.

Seafaring Stanchions,"These unmarked bracers of oxidized steel slip easily onto the wrists. As a swift action while submerged underwater, the wearer can tap the bracers together, causing the bracers and any armor he wears to immediately be removed. Removed armor is disassembled, becomes incredibly buoyant, and floats to the surface. After 4 hours, if the items are still in the water, they lose their buoyancy and sink.","2,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/seafaring-stanchions

Soulspeaker,"This grotesque, amulet-like shrunken head is said to contain the enslaved soul of its former owner. Forced to obey whomever carries it, once per day a soulspeaker can repeat a message as if the spell magic mouth were cast upon it. The owner must merely hold the 6-inch-in-diameter head and speak his message and the conditions under which the soulspeaker should repeat it. While it carries a message, the eyes of the stitched head stretch open, closing as soon as its message has been delivered.","2,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/soulspeaker
Robe of Bones,"This sinister item functions much like a robe of useful items for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead: Human skeleton, Wolf skeleton, Heavy horse skeleton, Fast goblin zombie, Tough human zombie, Plague ogre zombie","2,400 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-bones
Trollbone,"Runic engravings adorn this charred rib bone pulled from a slain troll. When the bone is tossed up to 20 feet away, it can grow into a full-sized troll under the user's control on command. The troll normally remains for 2d4 rounds, but if the user is maintaining a bardic performance when the item is activated, the duration is extended until the end of the performance. When the troll is slain or the duration ends, it turns back into a bone that then crumbles into dust.","2,400 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trollbone
Sovereign Glue,"This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.","2,400 ",20,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sovereign-glue
"Talisman, Death’s Head (24 HD)","This amulet allows the wearer to command a number of undead skeletons and zombies, which are keyed to the amulet when it is created. The animation of the undead is part of the creation process—undead that have already been created cannot be bound to a death’s head talisman. The number of HD of undead tied to the amulet is equal to twice the amulet’s caster level. The amulet allows the wearer to command the undead as if she had created them with animate dead, even if she has no magical talent of her own. The undead are only under control while the amulet is worn; if the amulet is removed, the undead revert to normal behavior, standing in place but responding if attacked. Once the specific undead tied to the amulet are destroyed, the talisman loses all power.","2,400 ",12,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-death-s-head

She also gains a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks and Survival checks in mountainous terrain (these bonuses stack with the altitude-based bonus above).

Bridle of Tricks (5 tricks),"Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated as knowing five additional tricks, as if it had been taught the tricks with the Handle Animal skill.

Voidstick,"In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the faithful to visit holy places with any regularity. In particular, the weak, the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk dangerous water crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to this, the godstick was born—a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine, carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus devotion at any location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign, however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the voidsticks and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry abominations. Each voidstick is 6 to 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20-foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.","2,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/voidstick
Apple of Eternal Sleep,"This ripe red apple looks fresh and delicious. Should anyone bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an immediate DC 19 Will saving throw or fall into an eternal slumber as though by the witch's grand hex of the same name. The victim can only be awakened by a casting of break enchantment, limited wish, wish, or miracle, or by a kiss from someone of royal blood.","2,500 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/apple-of-eternal-sleep
Bag of Holding (I),"This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. It can hold 250 lbs. in 30 cubic ft.. If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. ** Editor's Note: Bag of Holding refers to the space inside as 'non-dimensional' whereas the rules on extradimensional spaces explicitly refer to bags of holding as examples of extradimensional spaces. **","2,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding
Brass Spider,"This diminutive, shiny brass construct looks like a spider made of gears and cogs. It's roughly the size of an adult human's hand, and its legs are all picks, chisels, pliers, and other tools of fine manipulation. Its body contains reservoirs of powders and oils it can spray 2 inches out of its nozzle-spinnerets. A fine chain can be played out of a winch on the brass spider's back, connecting it to a small disk with studs and levers that control the construct's actions, enabling it to walk and crawl like a spider. It has no autonomous motivation. Once per day, a character holding the brass spider's chain can use the Disable Device skill from 15 feet away without penalty, though he must have line of sight to the device he is attempting to disable. In most cases, this means any mishap caused by the skill affects the brass spider (which has hardness 5 and 25 hit points) rather than the spider's controller. Additionally, the brass spider can be used without limit as masterwork thieves' tools, without the advantage of any additional range.","2,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/brass-spider
Coat of Pockets,"This black-and-gray wool coat sports over a dozen pockets on its front alone and even more line the insides. Interdimensional magic causes anything placed in one pocket to immediately appear in another randomly determined pocket. A character wearing this coat gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to hide a small object on her body. However, if a character wearing a coat of pockets places anything in one of the coat's pockets, she must spend a standard action to retrieve it (rather than a move action).","2,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coat-of-pockets

On command, the lantern floats alongside its user, shedding its light in whichever direction the user is looking. Once per day on command, the lantern can be designated to stand guard for up to 8 hours. The lantern ceases to shed light and keeps watch over a 30-foot-radius area centered on itself. The lantern acts as the alarm spell, except it is activated only by creatures that are Small or larger, and it cannot see invisible creatures. If the lantern detects a creature, it notifies the user that commanded the lantern with a mental alarm, waking the user if necessary. Once the lantern notifies its user, it shines its light on the intruder until commanded to stop.","2,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lantern-faithful
Medium's Harrow Mat,"This harrow mat allows a harrower to tap into the ancestral knowledge of nearby spirits. If a harrower uses this mat as an additional focus component while casting harrowing or greater harrowing, she treats her caster level as 1 higher. When this mat is used to perform a harrowing (magical or not) over a grave or other burial site, the spirit of the interned body influences the harrowing; for each card drawn related to the past, the harrower can draw from the deck twice and choose which card to place.","2,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/medium-s-harrow-mat
Oath breaker's Brand,"When this iron medallion is placed between the palms of two persons willingly entering into an agreement via handshake, the accord is enforced by the brand's enchantment. If either person breaks the word of the agreement, a hideous mark appears on the top of the unfaithful creature's hand. The brand marks her as an oath breaker throughout the River Kingdoms, imposing upon her a –8 penalty on Diplomacy and Bluff checks attempted anywhere in the region as long as the brand is visible. This mark lasts for 1 year or until it is removed by break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish, whichever comes first.","2,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/oath-breaker-s-brand-1

Cloak of Fiery Vanishing,"This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around the edges and smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect. The wearer’s invisibility and his illusory remains last for 5 rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, though this does not end the invisibility effect.","2,600 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-fiery-vanishing

Pirate Queen's Tricorne,"This black leather tricorne hat is weather-beaten and salt-stained. *Note* This item has a direct association with a specific deity. It grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim checks. If the hat's associated deity is your patron, once per day you can speak a command word to transform the hat into a small ship's boat such as a cutter, jolly boat, or longboat. The boat is 20 feet long, has two pairs of oars and a single mast with a square sail, and can carry up to 12 passengers and crew.

While false life is active, if you coup de grace a dying foe, your temporary hit points from the spell increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points).

It is more a symbol than an actual weapon, though the hilt is especially long, as if created for a Large creature. Once per day, you may use detect animals or plants.

"Gauntlet, Inheritor's Gauntlet","*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This metal gauntlet is the sort appropriate for wearing with chainmail, though versions suited for leather or full plate exist. Affixed to the wrist is a white cloth with a longsword embroidered in gold thread. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to give a weapon the wearer holds in that hand (or the gauntlet itself) a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. An Inheritor's gauntlet uses up the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another Inheritor's gauntlet) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching non-magical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw The Inheritor's symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first).","2,700 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gauntlet-inheritor-s-gauntlet
Stone of Alarm,"This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object.

Dimensional Acid (Living Pit),"The acid in this flask burns not through matter, but through space itself, creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively, it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid. This acid burns into a living dimension, creating a hungry pit where it lands.","2,700 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dimensional-acid
Necklace of Fireballs (II),"This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

"Elixir, Chon Chon","When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar to beast shape II, shifting the drinker's consciousness into a Tiny form cosmetically similar to that of a chon chon, with the same powers of flight, constant detect magic sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this transformation proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart to determine how long the effect lasts. [  (d%) - (Duration of Transformation): 1 - 1 minute; 2-25 - 1d10 minutes; 26-50 - 6d10 minutes; 51-75 - 1 hour; 76-80 - 1d10 hours; 81-85 - 6d10 hours; 86-90 - 1 day; 91-95 - 1d6 days; 96-99 - 1 week; 100 - Permanent  ] The transformation can be ended prematurely by remove curse—dispel magic has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached.","2,750 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-chon-chon
Book of Extended Summoning (Standard),"This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply the Extend Spell feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a metamagic rod for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal book of extended summoning can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment.

The oversized teeth last for 1 round, during which time the wearer can make a bite attack. Treat this attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 if the wearer is Small).

Three times per day, the wearer may activate the hood of the living to detect the auras of any undead creatures within a 30-foot radius. Doing so is a full-round action that discloses the presence of any undead auras, the number of undead auras, and the direction of the nearest undead aura, as though the user had concentrated for 3 rounds while using detect undead. When activated, a hood of the living also detects any living creatures within a 30-foot radius that are acting under the effects of a charm or compulsion created by an undead creature.

Barbed Pentacle of Asmodeus,"This iron disk is inscribed with an inverted pentagram, decorated around its outer edge with tiny metal barbs (facing slightly forward so as to not snag if worn outside clothing), and hangs from an iron chain. When worn visibly, it provides a +1 deflection bonus on AC. If Asmodeus is your patron, the pentacle counts as a holy symbol. By holding it and speaking a command word, you may use charm person once per day. If you squeeze the pentacle so its barbs draw your blood (1 point of damage), you may use that blood as ink, writing with a quill or even your finger for up to 1 hour; the blood-ink dries instantly on the writing surface so it never smudges, and if used as part of a magical spell you cast which requires or is augmented by writing (such as magic circle against evil or sepia snake sigil), the DC of that spell increases by +1.","3,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/barbed-pentacle-of-asmodeus
Cauldron of Brewing,A cauldron of brewing looks like a fine cooking pot with four stout legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid placed in it to a precise temperature (anywhere from just above room temperature to hot enough to boil salt water) and maintaining it indefinitely while still remaining only slightly warm to the touch on the outside.

Explosion Pocket,"An explosion pocket looks like a cloth pouch just large enough to contain a Small or Medium humanoid's hand. When placed against a shirt, vest, jacket, trousers, or similar piece of clothing, this ragged green patch attaches to the clothing, creating a loose pocket. The pocket functions as a normal pocket, but once per day the pocket’s wearer can, as a standard action by speaking a command word while his hand is in the pocket, cause the pocket to create a single vial of alchemist’s fire. If a vial of alchemist’s fire is in the explosion pocket when it is commanded to create a vial of alchemist’s fire, the pocket instead supercharges the existing vial within so that it inflicts double the normal fire damage a vial of alchemist’s fire would normally inflict. An explosion pocket can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different piece of clothing as the owner wishes. A vial of alchemist’s fire created or supercharged by an explosion pocket reverts to a vial of inert bitter-tasting water 1 minute after it is created or supercharged.","3,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/explosion-pocket

Horseshoes of Speed,"When affixed to an animal’s hooves, these iron horseshoes increase the animal’s base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.","3,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horseshoes-of-speed
Key of the Second Vault,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This elaborate key on a fine gold chain always glints, even in the dimmest light. The bearer can use it to lock (but not unlock) any non-magical lock as if it were the proper key. Once per day, the bearer can turn the key clockwise once to activate a shield of faith upon herself (though if the wearer is chaotic it provides only a +1 deflection bonus). If Master of the Vault is the bearer's patron, the key counts as a holy symbol. Once per day, the bearer can speak a command word and summon a two-headed eagle as if using summon monster II (the eagle's extra head does not grant it an extra attack). This eagle obeys the bearer's commands as if they shared a common language. While the key is worn as a pendant or held in hand, the bearer gains a +2 bonus on Appraise checks to assess an object's value.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/key-of-the-second-vault
Mask of Cutting Flesh,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This black leather mask is studded with bits of bone and metal, with smooth-sewn holes for the wearer's eyes, mouth, and nostrils. It laces in the back with long straps and covers the entire face, leaving only the ears and back of the head exposed. The wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can whisper a command word to lash out at a target within 100 feet, unerringly slashing the target with an invisible blade of force that deals 2d4+2 points of force damage (spell resistance applies). As a free action, the wearer can will the mask to unlace and reshape itself into a leather cap on top of the wearer's head, or hide itself within the wearer's shirt or helm.","3,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-of-cutting-flesh
"Mask, Miser’s","This wooden mask depicts the sunken face of a miser with an upturned nose. The mask grants the wearer the scent ability, but she can use it only to sense coins and gems. Each type and quality of gem has its own unique aura to the wearer, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks made to ascertain the value of gems.","3,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-miser-s
Ointment of Void Sealing,"Ointment of void sealing comes in a 4-gallon tub, typically made out of brass or some other durable metal. When a Medium or smaller character dunks his head into the tub of sticky, viscous goo as a standard action, the ointment flows over and around him with surprising alacrity until it has coated him in a thin but flexible layer that looks like translucent amber. Ointment of void sealing creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as planetary adaptation. After 3 hours, a coating of ointment of void sealing deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of ointment of void sealing contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures. Large creatures require 2 doses to gain the benefits of the ointment, while two Small creatures can share a single dose between them.","3,000 ",9,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/ointment-of-void-sealing
Pauldrons of the Serpent,"Constructed of mithral, each of these pauldrons bears an embossed device of a viper coiled defensively.

Poison Vial of Distance,"Favored by assassins, this magical vial allows the application of poisons at a range of up to 30 feet. The poison must be supplied, and must be a contact or ingested poison. The user adds the poison to the vial and then shakes it in the direction of the item or creature she wishes to affect, making a ranged touch attack (a poison vial of distance provides a +4 circumstance bonus on this roll). If the attack is successful, the poison is successfully delivered to the object or creature intended.","3,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/poison-vial-of-distance
Rope of Climbing,"A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner. A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied, but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.","3,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/rope-of-climbing
Scarf of the Suggestive Dance,"This silk scarf is embroidered with all the colors of a flame and tasseled in tiny beads.

"Slippers, Acrobat","These supple gray leather slippers enable the wearer to keep his balance in precarious positions. The wearer retains his Dexterity bonus to AC when climbing, running, or using the Acrobatics skill to move on narrow surfaces or uneven ground without falling. In addition, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus to CMD against trip maneuvers and on Reflex saves to avoid falling (including falling prone).","3,000 ",3,Faint,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRD22fzR7W3kYOmax7QWeMeNcfRZVgyxMyJOu62pYho/edit#gid=484815266
Spectacles of Understanding,"When worn, these innocent-looking spectacles convert any written language to one known by the wearer, as the comprehend languages spell. The glasses are also good at detecting falsified documents, granting their wearer a +5 bonus to Linguistics checks to identify forgeries and the ability make such checks untrained.","3,000 ",2,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spectacles-of-understanding
Tongue of the Hidden,"The least of the great seals, the tongue of the hidden is generally made of pewter inlaid with gold and tarnished silver. When this seal is in place, the genie within can see and hear his environs as if he were not imprisoned in a receptacle. Furthermore, the genie can speak via a magic mouth effect and can decide to have the magic mouth actually appear on the seal or not. The genie cannot cast spells through this link.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tongue-of-the-hidden
Vest of Surgery,"This emerald vest has four prominent and bulging pockets along its front. The wearer is always treated as if using a healer's kit when making Heal checks. Once per day, the wearer can make a DC 20 Heal check as if attempting to treat deadly wounds. If the check is successful, it cures 1d4 points of ability damage instead of hit point damage.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-of-surgery
Volatile Vaporizer (2nd),"This lime green pill is inedible but turns a potion into a cloud of mist that can be shared by multiple creatures. When placed inside a potion flask, the potion bubbles and froths itself into a pungent 10-foot-radius cloud. Any creature within the cloud when it appears gains the full effect of the potion. The cloud has no effect on creatures that cannot breathe. A creature may automatically resist the effects of the potion cloud by momentarily holding its breath. Using the pill destroys it and the potion. Each pill can only be used on potions of a particular spell level; using it on a potion of a different spell level has no effect (neither the potion nor the pill are consumed). The vaporizer also works on alchemist infusions, but not mutagens, extracts, or magical oils.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/volatile-vaporizer
Wand Key Ring,"Each of these rune-carved brass rings is keyed to a specific spell at creation.

"Wayfinder, Hypnotic","This wayfinder has a mother-of-pearl casing with perfect swirls of pink and green patterns covering the face of the device. It hangs on an 8-inch-long silver fob chain that makes it twirl slightly when held aloft. In addition to the standard functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a hypnotic wayfinder can be used once per day to mesmerize weak-minded creatures that can see it. When dangled by its fob and swung gently in a pendulum-like motion, the hypnotic wayfinder seems to change colors as light plays off its pearlescent exterior. This replicates the effects of hypnotic pattern (Will DC 13 negates), centered on the hypnotic wayfinder, but creates no visible light aside from the illusory color-shifts on the wayfinder itself. The wayfinder's wielder is immune to this effect, as are sightless creatures. While the effect is active, the wielder must remain stationary or the effect immediately ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the wielder swings the wayfinder at the end of its fob (a standard action) and for 2 rounds thereafter.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-hypnotic
"Workgloves, Engineer’s","These durable canvas and leather gloves imbue the wearer with an instinctive knowledge of mechanical devices. The wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft and Knowledge checks made to repair or understand mechanical devices. Once per day, the wearer may touch a device and instantly analyze it, learning its purpose and general method of operation, as well as diagnosing any acute malfunctions of the device, but not its magical powers or additional non-mechanical effects. For example, she could touch a pressure plate and understand that stepping on it would trigger a wall scythe trap attacking that square and that the trap resets automatically, but not that the trap includes a +1 flaming scythe coated in poison.","3,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/workgloves-engineer-s
Bead of Force,"This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. a bead of force can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.","3,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bead-of-force
Bell of Returning Spirits,"This ancient bronze hand bell has an ivory handle, and simple pictograms of animals are etched onto its exterior. Once per day on command, the user can ring the bell to summon his familiar to his side, as long as the familiar is within 100 feet of the user. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the user's level. The familiar immediately appears in a space of the user's choice adjacent to him. If the user's familiar is dead, this ability can be used summon its spirit back from beyond the grave. This functions as a raise dead spell, but can target only the user's familiar. The familiar doesn't need to be touched to accomplish this, though it must be within 100 feet. Any negative levels the familiar gains as a result of being raised are automatically removed at the rate of 1 per day, and any lost Constitution is automatically restored at the rate of 1 point per day. Once the bell has been used to raise a familiar, it transforms into inert clay and loses all of its magic abilities.","3,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bell-of-returning-spirits
"Boots, Dunestrider","These boots are cracked and weathered from the desert sun. When you wear dunestrider boots, you may walk on sand as if it were hardpacked earth. Overland movement across sandy desert is treated as plains. Even loose sand and quicksand are not difficult terrain for you, allowing you to cross them at normal speed.","3,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-dunestrider
Chime of Opening,"A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.","3,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chime-of-opening
"Clasp, Swarmbane","An ancient fossilized insect lies trapped within this ornate amber clasp, impaled by the long golden pin that fastens the wearer’s cloak. The wearer’s weapons, unarmed attacks, and natural attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of the swarm’s immunity to weapon damage (if any, although damage reduction applies as normal). If the wearer is damaged by a swarm, she automatically succeeds on her saving throw against the swarm’s distraction ability.","3,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/clasp-swarmbane
"Coin, Whispering","This ancient gold coin measures an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick. One face bears one of the seven ancient runes representing magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in an ancient language, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin— they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in the same ancient language while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either “yes” (the rune) or “no” (the broken column); the word “yes” or “no” is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not “Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?” The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not—if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a “yes” or “no” into the user's ear. The coin's one use for the day is still consumed.","3,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coin-whispering

Player's Prize,"This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes awarded to the winners of contests. The power of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's prize, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not be keyed to any other creature. Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate. A creature carrying a player's prize keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a –2 penalty on Will saves against that bard's bardic performances, as well as a –2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the player's prize. Once per day as an immediate action, the character whose personal rune is inscribed on the player's prize can speak the item's command word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand. The character must be within 30 feet of the player's prize to activate this ability.","3,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/player-s-prize
Swarmlord's Jar,"This small, lidded jar contains a sizable deformed insect that twitches and wriggles as if constantly undergoing a particularly painful death. A swarmlord's jar has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a swarmlord's jar is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried. A swarmlord's jar can be thrown to shatter at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that walks, a swarmlord's jar merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half).","3,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/swarmlord-s-jar
Tablet of the First Law,"The tablet lists anti-religious teachings along with several related verses that have been transcribed along the edges. When the tablet is read—a process that takes 10 minutes—its text glows with a golden light, providing the illumination of a candle, and the reader gains a +1 bonus on Will saving throws against all effects that come from a divine source for 24 hours. Only one person can benefit from this bonus at a time. A reader who possesses the Godless Healing feat can use the healing granted by that feat while reading the tablet. In this case, at the completion of the reading, the reader rolls twice and chooses the better roll when determining the amount of healing granted by Godless Healing.","3,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tablet-of-the-first-law
Philter of Love,"This potent preparation causes a creature who drinks it to fall madly in love with the first creature he or she perceives after consuming it. The drinker's attitude toward that creature becomes helpful. If a romantic attraction is possible toward the first person viewed, the drinker falls in love with that person. Otherwise, the drinker's love is a platonic adoration. The effects of the philter are permanent unless removed by a break enchantment, dispel magic, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.","3,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/philter-of-love
Gloves of Stolen Unlife,"These pale gray gauntlets feature cabochons of banded black onyx that slowly shift to white when the gloves are activated. Three times per day, the wearer can activate the gloves as a swift action after successfully affecting an undead creature with an offensive single-target spell. Doing so grants the wearer a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 + the Hit Dice of the affected undead (maximum +10), which last a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast.

Silver Nocking Point,"This small silver cylinder is no bigger than a pinhead and is engraved with an Elven aphorism that roughly translates to “unhindered flight.” A silver nocking point can be attached to the string of any bow or crossbow. When using a weapon equipped with a silver nocking point, a character can treat penalties for wind conditions as though they were one step less severe. For example, a character firing a ranged projectile in severe wind conditions would fire at a ranged penalty of –2 instead of –4. Magical wind effects that would normally deflect the projectile (such as fickle winds) instead impose only a –8 penalty on the attack roll.","3,150 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/silver-nocking-point

The belt’s wearer automatically succeeds at any check to guide with the knees, stay in the saddle, fight with a combat-trained mount, control a mount in battle, or make a fast mount or dismount, as long as the belt’s wearer is wearing medium, light, or no armor.

Bivouac Banners,"All three of these banners must be planted in the ground, with no two banners more than 40 feet apart, before they activate. An illusory mastiff manifests once all three banners are planted and walks a triangular circuit from banner to banner, moving at a speed of 30 feet. The illusory hound lasts for as long as the banners remain planted, to a maximum of 8 hours. After 8 hours, the ward ceases to function. The banners cannot be replanted and reactivated for 12 hours. Anytime a creature of Tiny or larger size crosses into the area delineated by the banners, the mastiff erupts in earsplitting barks. At the same time, the banners summon a riding dog (as per summon nature’s ally I). The dog appears adjacent to the square in which the ward was breached; if the ward was breached in multiple areas, the dog appears adjacent to a randomly selected breached square. The dog attacks the nearest intruder immediately. Any creatures standing within the warded area when the third banner is planted are excluded from the effects of the item, and can freely cross into and out of the area without triggering the mastiff’s attack.","3,200 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bivouac-banners
Explorer's Pith Helmet,"This colonial-style helmet protects the wearer from jungle nuisances.

Shackles of Compliance,"These battered iron manacles are typically found with a small spiked iron key in one of the locks. The shackles magically adjust themselves to fit around the wrists of any creature from Small to Large size and automatically lock. A creature wearing shackles of compliance becomes more susceptible to intimidation. Any creature attempting to intimidate or demoralize a target wearing shackles of compliance gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. In addition, the holder of the manacles’ key can cast command (DC 25 Will) on the wearer of the shackles three times per day. Shackles of compliance have hardness 10 and 10 hit points, and a DC 30 Disable Device check is required to pick the shackles’ lock.

"Crystal, Pallid","This finger-length crystal is a pale opaque pink color when worn by a living creature, but slowly changes to a translucent deep violet when carried by the undead. You can eat spoiled food and drink spoiled liquid as if it were fresh and wholesome, tasting as good as it did before it spoiled. Any person with the Profession (cook) skill can use the crystal to season a meal with the flavor of salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, or pepper (or the equivalent spices for the undead palate — fear’s breath, nightfog, bloodroot, thileu bark, or hatefinger). This item is associated with a specific deity. If you worship the associated deity, once per day you may use death knell. Both cure and inflict spells heal you, whether you are living or undead; the crystal flares with black or white energy when it converts this energy into a form that does not harm you. The crystal does not affect any other uses of positive or negative energy, just cure and inflict spells (or effects that duplicate these spells).","3,300 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crystal-pallid
"Stone, Nightstone of Sorrow","*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This black rock, usually worn on a heavy chain, looks pitted and partially charred and melted.

If the wearer takes 10 or more points of fire damage in a single round, a claw-shaped pattern glows faintly on the surface of the stone, similar to an arcane mark. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use shatter once per day. At will, the wearer can cause the claw-symbol on the rock to glow; true dragons immediately recognize the symbol as an icon of a dragon god.","3,300 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-nightstone-of-sorrow

Imploding Stone,"When activated, this black pebble acts as a limited gravitational singularity. Once the command word is spoken, the pebble delays for 1 round, then pulls all stone or earth within a 5-foot-diameter sphere toward it with irresistible force. This causes small tunnels to collapse inward, creating localized cave-ins. Imploding stones do not affect living creatures, though any creature in the same square as an activated imploding stone is caught in the bury zone of the collapse. Imploding stones are destroyed when used. Activating an imploding stone is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.","3,300 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/imploding-stone
Incense of Many Fates,"When used during meditation, this incense allows a samsaran's consciousness to pass through past or future lives to learn more about an important person, place, or thing. This functions like legend lore, but only works if the subject is at hand. The transcendental state lasts 1 hour, during which she can take no other actions. If she is disrupted during the meditation, the incense's effect is lost. Creatures other than samsarans can use this incense, but the connections to other lives are weaker and require a deeper meditation that takes 24 hours. Each block of incense lasts for 1 use.","3,300 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/incense-of-many-fates
"Runestone, Hydrodaemon","This water-polished stone is carved in the shape of a froglike head and decorated with evil runes. It feels lighter than it should, as if hollow and partially filled with liquid. When the stone is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a hydrodaemon appears as if summoned by a summon monster spell. Normally, the daemon is under the control of the creature that broke the runestone, but there is a 25% chance that the daemon is uncontrolled and attacks its summoner.","3,300 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-hydrodaemon

Spartoi Seeds,"Spartoi seeds appear as teeth stained by ash. The teeth themselves typically take the form of tiny dragon teeth, though some appear to come from a serpent, wolf, or human. When a tooth is cast upon the earth as a standard action, a spartolos under the user's command erupts on the following round. The spartolos lasts for 1 hour or until destroyed. A spartolos’s equipment vanishes if its owner is destroyed or after an hour. These seeds are typically found in simple pouches of leather or velvet containing 2d4 teeth. Up to six seeds can be sown by a single standard action.","3,300 ",Varied,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spartoi-seeds
Bag of Tricks (Gray),"This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following table to determine what animals can be drawn out of each. (d%) - (Animal): (01–30) - (Bat); (31–60) - (Rat); (61–75) - (Cat); (76–90) - (Weasel); (91–100) - (Riding dog). The heavy horse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider. Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to 10 Animals can be drawn from the bag each week, but no more than two per day.","3,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-tricks

Boots of the Mire,"These soft leather boots confer several powers upon the wearer. First, he is granted the power to walk on water in swampy environments, provided the water is no deeper than 5 feet—this effectively lets him move through swampy terrain and mud at no cost to his speed. He leaves no tracks or other sign of his passage as long as he's in swampy terrain, and never becomes uncomfortable or wet from rain, fog, or other forms of non-freezing precipitation. Finally, the boots grant him a +2 resistance bonus on all Fortitude saves made against poison and disease.","3,500 ",5,Faint,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRD22fzR7W3kYOmax7QWeMeNcfRZVgyxMyJOu62pYho/edit#gid=484815266
Boots of Vaulting,"The wearer of these suede boots ignores an additional 10 feet of falling distance when she successfully uses Acrobatics to soften a fall. Once per round as a free action, the wearer can use the boots to gain a +10 competence bonus on an Acrobatics check to jump, treating such jump as though she had a running start. The wearer also receives this +10 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity during the jump or to balance after landing. Using the boots in this fashion strains the lower body. If the wearer attempts a second such jump before at least 1 minute has passed, she must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the DC of her second jump attempt or injure her legs. This injury reduces her speed by half for 24 hours, or until she is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check or at least 1 point of magical healing. The DC of the Fortitude save increases by 5 for each additional jump attempted until at least 1 minute passes between jumps.","3,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-of-vaulting
"Boots, Trackless","Leaving marks of your passage can alert predators that a newcomer has entered their territory. Trackless boots help prevent you from making too much noise as you creep along, and they also mask traces of your passage through underground caverns to prevent your enemies from finding you. These boots are particularly valued by smugglers who work in patrolled areas. Trackless boots are soft, well-worn leather boots with thin soles. The softness of the boots’ soles add a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In addition, the boots conceal your passage much like the pass without trace spell — you leave no trail underground and cannot be tracked.","3,500 ",9,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-trackless
"Helm, Stag's Helm","This striking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag. Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as metal. When worn, the helm greatly enhances eyesight and hearing, granting a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, once per day the helm may be called upon to enhance any ranged attack made by the wearer to make an insightful shot. Activating this ability is a free action, and once activated, your next ranged attack against a target within 30 feet is made as if that target were flat-footed against you—this allows a rogue to gain the benefit of sneak attack with this shot. If you don’t make a ranged attack within 1 round of activating this power, the insight fades and is wasted for that day. A worshiper of the associated deity who wears this helm may utilize the insightful shot ability up to 3 times per day.","3,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-stag-s-helm

Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can cause the mask’s features to take on the appearance of any creature of the wearer’s basic size and shape within 60 feet that he observes, allowing the wearer to adopt that creature’s appearance for 1 hour. This grants him a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as the creature. The mask also grants the wearer a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against the creature he is disguised as, as the mask builds upon the wearer’s rage and jealousy of the target’s appearance.","3,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-stalker-s
"Medallion, Mind Sentinel","The surface of this silver medallion is covered in angular geometric shapes that refract light randomly. The medallion grants a continuous +2 resistance bonus on saves versus mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities , and supernatural abilities.

While worn, a star medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, it may be commanded to bestow the effects of false life on the wearer.

Mummified Guardian,"This mummified house cat—dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings— appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpse. In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp). If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration. A mummified guardian must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well.","3,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mummified-guardian

Dust of Disappearance,"This dust looks like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. a creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.

One application of the dust sprinkled over an object increases the target's weight by 100 pounds. Multiple applications stack, and the effect remains until the object is scrubbed clean of the metallic particles (taking a full-round action per application) or it takes 5 points of electricity damage per application. A creature struck directly with a thrown flask must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per application remaining in the flask) or gain heavy encumbrance and be unable to fly for 2d4 rounds.

Once per day, the wearer can breathe a cone of searing flame that functions as burning hands, except it deals electricity damage instead of fire. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can use eagle's splendor.

"Amulet, Righteous Fist","This golden amulet is used by religious sects as a way to help the faithful capture fugitives or defend themselves without doing undue harm to potential converts.

Belt of Teeth,"The brass buckle on this stout leather belt is fashioned to resemble three demonic faces. Once each round, this belt’s buckle can animate, lashing out at a creature that provokes an attack of opportunity within 5 feet. This attack uses its wearer’s base attack bonus and Strength modifier, with a +4 competence bonus. It deals damage as a bite attack made by a creature of its wearer’s size (1d6 for a Medium wearer; see Table: Natural Attacks by Size) plus the wearer’s Strength modifier.

Boots of the Eternal Rose,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. These leather boots are found in a variety of styles but always have a prominent engraving of a rose. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Perform (dance) and Stealth checks. The wearer may move through areas of flowers (whether wild-growing or a garden) at normal speed and without suffering any impairment or taking damage from thorns, brambles, or similar hazards; areas of flowers that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the wearer. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, the wearer may use daze monster once per day; if the wearer is dancing, singing, or using some other Perform skill as part of a performance lasting at least 1 minute, he may activate daze monster as a free action during his performance.

Cautionary Creance,"This slim leather leash is just over 100 feet long, incredibly light, and uncannily strong, making it an excellent tool for training birds of prey and other flying predators. It grants a +4 circumstance bonus on any Handle Animal check made to train such animals. When used to bind a flying animal companion or familiar to its master, the leash allows the master to cast feather fall on the creature at will. If the master has the share touch spells class ability, once per day he can use that ability on the leashed creature, even if they are not touching. The delivered spell can be no higher than 3rd level.

"Gem, Phantasmal","This small cut crystal appears to be filled with hazy, indistinct images that constantly shift and vary. If a spellcaster holding the phantasmal gem casts an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (or concentration + a number of rounds), the illusion lasts up to an additional 10 rounds after the spellcaster ceases concentrating on it. The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift action. The phantasmal gem can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome using a phantasmal gem can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities gained through the gnome magic racial trait. Each spell-like ability expended as a standard action recharges 1 round of duration to the phantasmal gem (up to a maximum of 10 rounds).","4,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/phantasmal-gem
Gloves of Arrow Snaring,"Once worn, these snug gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible to casual observation. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for the feat. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective, and at least one hand must be free to take advantage of the magic.","4,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-arrow-snaring
"Gloves, Ghostvision","These gloves are made of pale gray silk; each is adorned with an embroidered silver eye on the back. Once per day the wearer may activate them, as a standard action, by bowing her head and pressing her hands to her eyes. The embroidered silver eyes flare and open, and when the wearer lowers her hands, deep pools of swirling gray mist hide her own eyes and allow her to more clearly see the restless dead for the next 10 rounds. While active, ghostvision gloves grant the following effects. The wearer can see all undead within 60 feet clearly, including ethereal undead and incorporeal undead hiding in objects or walls to a depth of 5 feet. If the wearer has the channel positive energy class ability, she may expend one use of channeled positive energy to make a ranged touch attack against one undead creature within channel range. If the ranged touch attack hits, she rolls channel energy damage against that target (affecting no other creatures), except she rolls d12s instead of d6s.

While worn, an imperious headband grants its wearer a +4 deflection bonus to his AC against any attack made by a hireling, a slave, a servant, or any other sentient creature in his employ. In addition, such creatures must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or treat their master as if he were affected by a sanctuary spell. If such creatures are subject to magical compulsion to attack the wearer, they must roll all attack rolls and checks to overcome spell resistance against the wearer twice and take the lower result.","4,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-imperious
"Ointment, Restorative","A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep, and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as neutralize poison with a +5 bonus on the check). Applied to a diseased area, it removes disease (as remove disease with a +5 bonus on the check).

Pendant of the Souk,"Crafted from gold beaten into the image of a lanner falcon and suspended upon a gold chain, it's the traditional badge of office for a Prince or Princess— although they are often given as rewards to those who are particularly helpful or well-liked by the Prince or Princess. The wearer of a pendant of the souk gains a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks. By holding the pendant to her brow, the wearer can gain the effects of an identify spell once per day. Finally, the pendant grows warm in the presence of illusions, granting a +2 insight bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve existing illusion effects.","4,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pendant-of-the-souk
Pressure Suit,"This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit’s seal is broken—such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink—all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent’s confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft (armor) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a –1 armor check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot.","4,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pressure-suit
Sandals of Quick Reaction,"These supple leather sandals grant a burst of speed during times of duress.

Talisman of Beast Training,"This talisman is worn lashed around the neck and is made of flexible bark woven into a mesmerizing pattern. While wearing a talisman of beast training, a wearer finds that animals become much more patient with her and amenable to training. As such, failed Handle Animal checks made during downtime periods—including those made to rear animals and teach them new tricks—may be treated as if they were successful. The talisman can turn 10 failed checks into successes this way. Once the tenth failed check has been converted to a success, the talisman falls apart and becomes useless.","4,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-of-beast-training
"Vambraces, Inquisitor’s Bastion","Constructed of blackened steel, these vambraces augment the protection granted to the inquisitor by the protection judgment.

Amulet of Elemental Strife,"This amulet shines brightly when brought within 60 feet of an outsider with the elemental subtype, shedding light as a torch. The amulet glows a different color depending on the subtype of the elemental or elementals present (white for air, yellow for earth, red for fire, and blue for water). If more than one subtype is present, the gem flickers back and forth between the appropriate colors. The wearer gains resistance 5 against a single energy type determined by the subtype of the closest elemental present (air grants electricity resistance, earth grants acid resistance, fire grants fire resistance, and water grants cold resistance). If the closest elemental possesses multiple subtypes, the wearer may choose which type of resistance she gains. This energy resistance only applies against attacks from elementals. The amulet also allows any attacks made by the wearer to bypass the damage reduction of such creatures.","4,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-elemental-strife
"Aquarium Ball, Replenishing (Greater)","Replenishing aquarium balls act as standard aquarium balls, but are endowed with magical effects beneficial to the creature held within. The power of the magic depends on the kind of replenishing aquarium ball. The ball continually refreshes itself with clean water and fresh food. In addition, a greater replenishing aquarium ball is magically enhanced so that the glass is as hard as stone (hardness 8, 15 hp) without increasing its weight.","4,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/aquarium-ball-replenishing

A mutineer's bane earring has additional effects if worn by a commodore or admiral. If worn by a commodore, that commodore's squadron gains a +3 bonus on morale checks in fleet battles.

Escape Ladder,"This 10-foot long rope ladder unrolls itself on command, extending upward into the air and magically holding itself in place. The ends of each rope have small loops for tying to another rope, a grappling hook, a piton, or similar fixtures. A second command word makes the ladder roll itself again, pulling itself toward whichever end the speaker is touching. Climbing the ladder is a DC 0 Climb check. The ladder can hold up to 300 pounds if holding itself in the air, or 600 pounds if attached to a sturdy surface. A third command word creates an extradimensional space at the top of the ladder that is identical to rope trick, except it only holds up to one Medium creature and has a very short duration. When a creature enters the extradimensional space, at the end of the creature's turn the space collapses and the creature is transported as though by dimension door 1d6 x 100 feet away in a random direction to a safe, ground-level location. The ladder remains behind and falls to the ground when this power is used.

Smear of Seeing,"This oily black paste is kept in a glass jar about the size of a human's fist. When rubbed onto an opaque surface as a standard action, an application of smear of seeing allows others to see through it for 10 minutes or until it is thoroughly diluted with universal solvent, after which the smear loses its potency. Anyone on the side of the surface on which the smear was applied can see through that surface as though it were a clear glass window. This does not enable creatures to hear through the surface. Creatures on the other side of a surface affected with smear of seeing cannot see the effect, but may detect it via detect magic or other effects as normal. Smear of seeing can be used on plaster, stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. Smear of seeing has no effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness. One application of smear of seeing is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications can be used to increase the affected surface area. One jar of smear of seeing contains enough paste for five applications.","4,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/smear-of-seeing
Spirit Planchette (Brass),"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist—brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface—it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette’s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board—at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the séance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below.  The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day—the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a –2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient—the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically “maybe.” If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie. [  (Questions per Use) - (Will save DC) - (Confusion Duration) - (True Answer) - (Lie): 1 - 11 - 1 round - 01–60 - 61-100  ]","4,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spirit-planchette
"Bead, Boro (2nd)","This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any one 2nd level extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day.

"Gem, Metamagic (Maximizing Sapphire)","Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a full-round action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action). The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created—their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding unique gemstone type associated with it.","4,000 ",11,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-metamagic

Marvelous Pigments,"These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments—precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on—appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous.","4,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/marvelous-pigments
Page of Spell Knowledge (2nd),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 2nd level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","4,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (2nd),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 2nd level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.","4,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power
"Salve, Stone Salve","This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the stone to flesh spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a stoneskin spell. The price and creation cost given are per ounce.","4,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-salve

Spell Lattice (2nd),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","4,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
Homunculus Clay,"If a mutagen is poured onto this fist-sized lump of dry clay (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), it transforms into a homunculus. It treats the alchemist who provided the mutagen as its creator. The homunculus gains the benefits of the mutagen. For every 2 points its Constitution would be increased, it instead gains 1 additional hit point per Hit Die and a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves, and the DC of its poison increases by 1. When the effect of the mutagen ends or the homunculus is slain, it reverts to a lump of clay that can be used again at a later time. If the homunculus clay is broken or destroyed in its inactive form, it is forever ruined.","4,100 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/homunculus-clay
"Robe, Liar's","This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a liar's robe enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features, and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a liar's robe must use true seeing or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as detect thoughts or locate creature) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.","4,180 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-liar-s
Resilient Ore,"This lumpy piece of unforged iron originates from metal that remained cool after smelting, resisting all attempts to forge it into another shape. It is sometimes used as a mace head or as a counterweight to a greatsword or other large weapon. This item is associated with a specific god or goddess. When worn, you gain fire resistance 1 and +1 resistance bonus on Will saving throws. If you are a worshiper of the associated god or goddess, once per day you may use this to cast chill metal. At will, you may use it to mend small metallic items as if using a mending spell.","4,200 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/resilient-ore
Crusader's Scabbard,"[  Statistics: Alignment - Lawful Good; Senses - 60 ft.; Intelligence - 10; Wisdom - 12; Charisma - 14; Ego - 6; Communication - Speech (Common)  ] Three times per day, this scabbard can cast bless weapon on any weapon sheathed within, but does so reluctantly on any weapon other than a longsword. While the user is in combat, the scabbard hurls threats of righteous retribution in a loud, clear voice as it attempts to demoralize opponents (Intimidate bonus of +7). The consciousness within the crusader's scabbard is valorous and stridently condemns displays of cowardice or dishonesty.","4,250 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crusader-s-scabbard
Glowing Gourd,"This gourd has been hollowed out and carved with the symbol of a good-aligned deity. It sheds light as a candle. If the gourd is smashed onto the ground, the 40-foot-radius area around the crushed gourd is affected as if by hallow with a remove fear spell fixed to it. This magic item is often crafted from a pumpkin, though other types of gourds, or even large turnips, can be used.","4,250 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/glowing-gourd
Necklace of Fireballs (III),"This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer. [  (1) - 7d6, (2) - 4d6, (4) - 3d6 ]","4,350 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necklace-of-fireballs
Wind-Caller Compass,"This light gray compass made of fine metal, and is engraved with various depictions of the sun, moon, and clouds.

Slippers of Cloud Walking,"The wearer of these slippers may walk on air (as the spell air walk) for up to 10 minutes per day, which may be used in 1-minute increments and requires no action to activate. However, she may only walk on air within or on top of natural or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases such as those created by acid fog, cloudkill, incendiary cloud, or stinking cloud. Walking on top of such clouds carries no danger for the wearer, but walking through the cloud has its normal effect.","4,400 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/slippers-of-cloud-walking
"Chain, Broken Chain of the Beast","*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This 8-foot length of corroded, broken chain is threaded with a leather strap to hold it together; it is worn like a belt and must be tied in place, as it lacks a buckle. Once per day, the wearer can call upon its power to summon an evil creature from the summon monster I list; the creature attacks the wearer's enemies if any are present, but it is not under the wearer's control and attacks the wearer or the wearer's allies if there are no more enemies to kill. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, the wearer can gain the benefits of a rage spell once per day by speaking the god's name. If the wearer is ever bound, shackled, or otherwise rendered helpless while still conscious, this rage ability automatically activates if the wearer hasn't already used it that day.","4,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chain-broken-chain-of-the-beast

"Gauntlets, Impact","These gauntlets are made of worn leather; the palms are smooth, but the wrists and backs of the gauntlets are covered in rough pebbles of various shapes and colors. The wearer can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks and similar projectiles as if she possessed the rock catching monster ability, as long as she has at least one hand free. A rock caught by the wearer shrinks and is permanently absorbed into the gauntlets. A wearer who also possesses the rock catching ability can catch rocks twice per round instead of once.","4,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gauntlets-impact
Goblin Fire Drum (Greater),"This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the player deal an additional 1 point of fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version). All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer's turn as long as the playing continues. A greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and can create pyrotechnics once per day.","4,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goblin-fire-drum
Stinging Stiletto,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This tiny dagger has a black leather hilt and a gold-inlaid pattern of stripes and sharp angles on its steel blade. It can transform into a delicate necklace or ornate finger-ring at the wearer's command. The wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks while the item is carried or worn. The wearer can also use it to cast ghost sound once per day. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer may speak a command word to use fox's cunning. As a standard action, the wearer can prick her finger with the dagger and swear an oath on her own blood to avenge herself against a particular named creature; the wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on her next attack roll within 1 minute against that creature. Speaking a new vengeance-oath removes the old one, whether or not the wearer has achieved her vengeance.","4,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stinging-stiletto
"Gloves, First Aid","These fingerless gloves of white cloth have a sapphire decorating the base of each exposed finger, numbering 10 in all. The wearer of a pair of first aid gloves can, as a standard action, cast any of the following spells (caster level 9th), permanently expending a number of sapphires equal to the spell's level (as denoted in parentheses after each spell): breath of life (5), cure critical wounds (4), cure light wounds (1), cure moderate wounds (2), cure serious wounds (3), and mass cure light wounds (5). When casting a spell from the gloves, the wearer can't expend sapphires on different hands, thus only a full hand's worth of gems can be used to cast breath of life or mass cure light wounds. Regardless, both gloves must be worn to function. Once all of the sapphires are expended, a pair of first aid gloves becomes non-magical.","4,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-first-aid
Knight's Pennon (Battle),"This narrow cloth flag is made to attach to the end a knight's lance, though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or even a staff.

Knight's Pennon (Parley),"This narrow cloth flag is made to attach to the end a knight's lance, though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or even a staff. It has no effect if not mounted appropriately. The white knight's pennon of parley, when displayed approaching a negotiation, grants the bearer a +4 enhancement bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks for 1 hour, so long as the bearer does not initiate any hostile action.","4,500 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/knight-s-pennon
Void Dust,"Infused with the essence of destruction, a pinch of void dust unmakes force effects. If sprinkled on or thrown at a force effect, it acts as a dispel magic, unless the force effect is immune to dispel magic, in which case it acts like disintegrate. Void dust can be sprinkled on an adjacent force effect or thrown up to 10 feet. No attack roll is required. A single pinch affects only a single force effect. A found container holds three pinches.","4,500 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/void-dust
Trollblood Elixir,"This rancid, bubbling tonic is mud-colored and reeks of sweat, gore, and decay. Upon drinking a dose of trollblood elixir, the imbiber gains fast healing 5. This fast healing is even capable of reattaching a severed limb that is pressed against its stump for 1 round, as long as the limb has been severed for no more than 1 hour and is essentially intact. The effects of trollblood elixir last 1 minute; during this time, the imbiber is nauseated. Each round, the imbiber can choose to prematurely end the elixir's effects by succeeding at a DC 10 Fortitude save as a full-round action. Trollblood elixir does not affect objects or nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead.","4,550 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trollblood-elixir
Cassock of the Clergy,"The cut and color of this solemn vestment varies from religion to religion, but its properties are the same. The wearer may command the cassock of the clergy to display the holy symbol of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic level, the garment functions as a divine focus. Additionally, the wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence creatures that match her alignment or that of her patron deity. Also, the wearer may use bless and sanctuary (DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional orison each day. If the wearer is a spontaneous divine caster, once per day she may spend 1 hour in prayer to gain an orison of her choice as a spell known for the next 24 hours.","4,600 ",1,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cassock-of-the-clergy
Circlet of Speaking,"This thin, silver circlet allows an animal wearing it to speak, even if it is not normally capable of doing so because of its low Intelligence score or lack of known languages. The creator of the item decides what language the circlet's wearer can speak when she crafts the item (typically Common); once crafting is complete, this cannot be changed. A circlet of speaking does not grant an animal a bonus to Intelligence, and the wearer's general behavior remains largely the same while it wears a circlet of speaking, though it can communicate its desires and rudimentary knowledge as though being spoken to via speak with animals.","4,800 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/circlet-of-speaking
Slippers of Spider Climbing,"When worn, a pair of these slippers enables movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her climb speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces—make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses (minimum 1 minute per use).","4,800 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/slippers-of-spider-climbing
"Spectacles, Physician's","These nondescript, brass-rimmed spectacles have green-tinted lenses and are favored by practicing doctors and adventurers alike.

Incense of Meditation,"This small rectangular block of sweet-smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check. When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat). Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.","4,900 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/incense-of-meditation
Bone Razor,"This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat but easily cuts flesh. If used to perform a coup de grace on a helpless living creature and the creature dies from the attack, the creature's flesh begins to peel off and its bones animate as a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor. The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses the razor to flense and animate another creature's bones, the previous animate skeleton is immediately destroyed.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bone-razor
Bracers of Archery (Lesser),"These wristbands appear similar to greater bracers of archery, though they are typically constructed of lighter material.

Floating Sail (10ft x 15ft),"This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating sail unfurls up to its full size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second time, the floating sail folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker (this space must be one that the floating sail was touching while unfurled). If the floating sail is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses and takes the form of a normal silk sail; depending on whether the sail was placed on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing on it may become entangled in the sail, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly, a floating sail immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed floating sail must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated again.[  Capacity (lbs.) - 800  ]","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/floating-sail
Gauntlets of Twisting Vines,"These wrist wraps are actually dark, thorny vines that constantly move and twist around the wearer's hands of their own accord. The wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, and steal. Once per day when the wearer successfully pins a foe with a grapple check, the vines can move off the wearer (ending the circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks), envelop the target, and tie it up. A tied-up victim can escape the vines by succeeding at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check that pinned the victim. The character who was wearing the gauntlets when they were used to envelop a target can remove them from the target as a move action.

Gloves of Arcane Striking,"These soft leather gloves are decorated with even rows of mithral rivets. Requirement: Only a spellcaster with the Arcane Strike feat can activate the abilities of these gloves. These abilities are as follows: When the wearer uses the aid another action to improve an ally’s attack roll, the ally adds the wearer’s Arcane Strike damage bonus to its damage roll for that attack. When the wearer makes an attack using Arcane Strike and hits, enemies adjacent to the target take damage equal to the wearer’s Arcane Strike damage bonus. This damage is of the same type as the weapon’s damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and so on). When the wearer uses the aid another action to improve an ally’s Armor Class, the ally also adds the wearer’s Arcane Strike damage bonus to his AC against the opponent.","5,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-arcane-striking
"Gloves, Poisoner’s","These black, rubbery gloves have sharpened digits. Fine channels lead to the tip of each finger, which are often stained with foul chemicals. The gloves are used primarily by assassins to deliver poisons while in combat. Each glove may be filled with a single dose of poison, a potion, alchemist infusion, holy water, or similar liquid as long as the liquid would not harm the gloves (for example, alchemist’s fire and acid cannot be used). The wearer can deliver the dose to a target as a melee touch attack or as part of an unarmed strike or natural attack with the hands (such as a claw or slam attack). In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance. The wearer can use both gloves in the same round using two-weapon fighting or multiple natural attacks (such as 2 slams or 2 claws). Each glove can be used once per day. Filling a glove is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-poisoner-s

On command, the wearer can gain the scent ability with a range of 10 feet (20 feet upwind, 5 feet downwind) as the wolf aspect of the hunter's animal focus class feature.

Hospitality's Hammock,"A luxurious crimson silk hammock embroidered with gold thread and gold fringed tassels, a hospitality's hammock is a beauty to behold, but no self-respecting seaman would ever be caught using it. Aside from the hammock's considerable looks, a single night's rest in it eliminates any sign of seasickness. Additionally, a hospitality's hammock is so comfortable that those who sleep in it for a full 8 hours regain hit points as if they had an entire day of bed rest. Climbing into or out of the hammock is a full-round action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity check reduces this to a move action.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hospitality-s-hammock
Living Garments,"These sheer and silky robes, many of which are made of spider silk, are of the finest quality. On command, a living garment can make a number of subtle adjustments to itself, including coloring, fit, and basic design, accommodating and accentuating whatever mood the wearer wishes to convey. It always remains clean, and automatically repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point per round (hardness 0, 4 hit points).

When worn with the white side out, it allows the wearer to use detect magic once per day. When worn with the black side out, it allows the wearer to use read magic once per day. If the associated deity is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use the black side of the mask to cast magic missile as a 3rd-level caster once per day.

"Saddle, War","This military saddle is made of cured hide, with numerous straps and hooks to allow it to be easily configured to fit different sizes of animals and saddlebags. Any creature of the animal or magical beast type of an appropriate shape to wear a saddle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion) can wear the war saddle, which magically changes size and shape as necessary. The saddle allows the creature wearing it to act as if it were combat trained (see Handle Animal for more information on combat training), and gives the rider a +5 competence bonus on Ride checks made while mounted upon the creature.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/saddle-war
Scabbard of Stanching,"This fine, red leather sheath is decorated with gold filigree. It fits any bladed slashing weapon. While worn, a scabbard of stanching protects against bleed damage. Anytime the wearer suffers a bleed effect, the scabbard automatically stanches it. It has no effect on bleed damage from effects that require a DC 16 or higher caster level or Heal check.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/scabbard-of-stanching
Sheath of Bladestealth,"This mundane-looking but serviceable sheath fits any bladed slashing weapon, from a dagger to a greatsword. When a weapon is placed into the sheath of bladestealth, both it and the weapon become invisible (as the invisibility spell) until the weapon is drawn, at which point it and the sheath become visible again. The invisible sheathed weapon can still be detected by touch, but the bearer gains a +5 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the weapon, and casual inspection does not reveal it at all. Other effects that detect or reveal invisible things work normally on the sheathed weapon.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sheath-of-bladestealth
Soaring Cathedra,"This large sedan chair is made of light but sturdy blackwood and is draped with white silk coverings. Inside, there is room for two medium-sized occupants on a bed of silken pillows and thick padding. Its movement is controlled by one of the occupants. It always floats a few feet above the ground and moves horizontally with a speed of 10 feet, though the occupants can make it land or float again as a free action.","5,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/soaring-cathedra
Steadfast Grapple,"This iron grappling hook is attached to a 50-foot length of silk rope. When a steadfast grapple is thrown, it automatically hits and attaches to any targeted object or structure within range of its rope. Against creatures, the wielder must make attack rolls as normal. Once attached, a steadfast grapple can only be removed with a DC 30 Strength check, the command word, or magic such as dispel magic.","5,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/steadfast-grapple
Stone of Alliance,"This tiny sphere of marble can be used to strengthen an existing link between the user and a creature bound to him. When activated by a creature and then swallowed by that creature's animal companion, bonded mount, or familiar, the stone magically remains inside the companion creature. Thereafter, the master is continually aware of the companion's distance, direction, and general condition as if using the spell status. If the master has line of sight to the companion, he may as an immediate action protect the creature from being harmed by one successful attack, taking the full effect of that attack instead. Once per day the master may spend a standard action to transfer the blinded, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition from the companion to himself. Alternatively, the master may partially transfer the exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition from the companion to himself, with he and the companion both suffering the lesser version of that condition (fatigued for exhausted, and so on). The master must be within 30 feet of the companion for him to use either aspect of this ability. The stone remains harmlessly inside the companion until it dies, the master dies, or the master dismisses the companion, at which point it crumbles into a worthless powder and is digested.","5,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-of-alliance
Tunic of Careful Casting,"This woolen garment is decorated with a pattern of linked chains embroidered in silver and black thread.

"Wayfinder, Tireless","Tireless wayfinders have burnished copper cases and silver inner workings. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), the bearer of a tireless wayfinder halves the Strength and Dexterity penalties for being fatigued or exhausted, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion. The tireless wayfinder must be in a creature's possession for 1 full week before these benefits apply, and they are lost if it leaves the creature's possession for more than 1 hour.","5,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-tireless
Admixture Vial,"Once per day, an alchemist can use this simple-looking glass vial to combine two extracts into one usable extract as if he had the combine extracts discovery. An admixture vial can combine extracts of 3rd level or lower. Extracts combined with an admixture vial cannot be combined again using this item or the combine extracts discovery.","5,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/admixture-vial
Amulet of Uncanny Defense,"This heavy, cold-iron amulet depicts a bear's head with jaws open in a roar. It increases the wearer's uncanny dodge ability, causing it to function as improved uncanny dodge. (The amulet has no benefit for characters who do not have uncanny dodge). If the wearer already has improved uncanny dodge, treat his class level as 4 higher for the purpose of determining the number of rogue levels an attacker must have in order to sneak attack the wearer by flanking him.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-uncanny-defense
Bag of Concealment (I),"A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size (it can hold 250 lbs in 30 cubic ft), except for a few key points. Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only be keyed to one person at a time)—should the bag’s owner be killed, it becomes keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag’s outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag’s magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as non-magical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger goods may be hidden inside.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-concealment
Bag of Holding (II),"This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. It can hold 500 lbs. in 70 cubic ft.. If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. ** Editor's Note: Bag of Holding refers to the space inside as 'non-dimensional' whereas the rules on extradimensional spaces explicitly refer to bags of holding as examples of extradimensional spaces. **","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding
"Belt, Blinkback","A set of clips is attached to this segmented belt constructed of metallic links. Up to two one-handed melee weapons or up to four light melee weapons can be hung from the belt in straps or sheaths. When the wearer draws a weapon attached to this belt and throws it before the end of her next turn, the weapon teleports back to its strap or sheath immediately after the attack is resolved.","5,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-blink-back
Brain Cylinder,"A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder’s side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder’s surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points—cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation—the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/brain-cylinder
Collar of Obedience,"This collar of bright red leather bears a small golden pendant and makes the wearer much more biddable and compliant. The wearer takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects used by the creature that placed the collar on it, and that creature gains a +4 bonus on Handle Animal checks to train or push the wearer. Any other creatures take a –4 penalty on Handle Animal checks against the wearer, and the wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against their mind-affecting effects. A collar of obedience can be placed on any Small, Medium, or Large creature. Placing a collar of obedience on a creature is a full-round action that requires a successful grapple maneuver. Removing the collar is also a full-round action, and the creature removing it must have precise digits capable of working the locking mechanism. A creature made helpful with wild empathy does not resist having the collar equipped or removed.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/collar-of-obedience
"Fan, Red Feather","This fan is made of copper fashioned into a dozen small feathers mounted on a ring-shaped bone handle. Once per day, the bearer can hold it and speak a command word to counterspell a darkness effect (as if using daylight) or counterspell a light effect (as if using deeper darkness). If activated in an area of overlapping light and darkness effects, the fan randomly counterspells one of them, leaving the other intact.","5,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/fan-red-feather
Horn of the Huntmaster,"This elongated horn curves sharply at the end, almost making it seem more like an enormous pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow the horn as a standard action; this grants his full favored enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The effect lasts for 1 minute.","5,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horn-of-the-huntmaster
Infernal Cord,"The entirety of this thick hide belt is scarred with impressions of fiendish visages, each shifting between a scowl and a smile. This belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Treat this Constitution bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. Whenever an enemy scores a critical hit against the wearer, the wearer gains fast healing 1 for 1 minute. This ability doesn't trigger if the critical hit deals only nonlethal damage. Damage caused by silver weapons, good-aligned weapons, or spells or effects with the good descriptor doesn't trigger the fast healing, and suppresses the fast healing for 1 round if it's already active. The wearer of an infernal cord can be detected as though she were an evil creature, and can sense the item's evil while wearing it. This belt imparts 1 negative level to any non-evil creature that wears it until the belt is removed.","5,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/infernal-cord
Insistent Doorknocker,"This iron gargoyle face holds an iron ring in its mouth. Once per day, when the flat back of the gargoyle face is placed against a wall, floor, or ceiling, it fuses into place, creating a usable door and penetrating the space beyond up to 1 foot as if using passwall. Speaking the command word again ends the passwall effect, returns the surface to its previous doorless shape, and releases the doorknocker from the surface.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/insistent-doorknocker

"Jacket, Sipping","Absorbent fibers line this heavy canvas coat. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can pour a potion onto this lining, suffusing it into the coat. If the potion has an instantaneous duration, the wearer can activate the coat as a swift action to consume the potion. If the potion’s duration is measured in rounds, the wearer can activate the coat as a swift action to gain the potion’s benefits for 1 round, repeating as desired each round until the potion’s entire duration has been used. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The coat absorbs only potions with instantaneous or round-based durations, and only those which affect creatures (for example, it does not work on oils). Once the coat absorbs a potion, the potion cannot be retrieved from it, only used as described above. The absorbed potion loses its powers after 24 hours, even if unused.","5,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/jacket-sipping
Lenses of Situational Sight,"These wire spectacles are fitted with several ground crystal filters on hinged arms, any combination of which can be moved in front of or away from the lenses as a standard action (one, two, or all three lenses may be positioned at the same time with one action). Each filter grants a specific sense to the wearer when it is placed before one of the lenses. Each set of filters can be used for 10 minutes in 1-minute increments before losing its magical properties. The three sets of lenses are as follows. [  ** Green Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits of detect magic. The wearer doesn't need to concentrate to gain the benefits of the spell as long as a source of magic remains in her line of sight for the appropriate number of rounds. ** Pink Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits of see invisibility. ** Purple Lenses: Grant the wearer darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. If the wearer already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 60 feet while she uses these filters.  ]","5,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lenses-of-situational-sight
Mallet of Building,"This heavy builder's mallet has a wooden shaft and a head made from shiny black iron that turns slightly red when held close to metal. The wielder of the mallet can, as a full-round action, swing the hammer to create and immediately hammer into place a copper nail, iron spike, iron piton, or 4-foot wooden fence post. A created fence post can penetrate earth, and the other materials can penetrate earth, wood, or stone. Removing the created item from the surface destroys it, but otherwise the item lasts as long as a normal object of its sort. The mallet can create up to 100 items per day.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mallet-of-building
Paradox Box,"A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box—it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box—most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds because a particularly clever person can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/paradox-box
Polymorphic Pouch,"This leather pouch is usually decorated with a druidic motif. Within is an extradimensional space that can hold 4 cubic feet or 40 pounds worth of items and otherwise functions as a small bag of holding. If the bearer uses a polymorph effect or wild shape to transform into an animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin, the pouch never merges with her body. It automatically relocates to an easily-accessible place on her body (such as on a belt or a cord around her neck), allowing her to access the pouch and items within it while she is transformed.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/polymorphic-pouch
Riverseer Plate,"This disc of thick green glass is 12 inches in diameter and has a small, stylized image of a boat acid-etched into its center. When set against the deck of a waterborne vessel, the plate warns of nearby obstacles on or under the water, presenting them as glowing green silhouettes on the glass in relation to the boat etched on the plate's center. A riverseer plate warns of inanimate dangers within a 300-foot radius beyond the vessel in which it is set, providing a +6 competence bonus on sailing checks to navigate the vessel around potential dangers (see Ultimate Combat for the full rules on sailing checks). Once per day, a creature can apply a drop of blood to a riverseer plate's surface. For 5 minutes thereafter, the plate marks the location of Small or larger animate creatures in the water around the vessel, presenting them on the plate's surface as glowing red dots.","5,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/riverseer-plate
Robe of Components,"The pockets of this simple blue robe always seem to carry just what the wearer needs whenever she casts a spell. The robe functions as a spell component pouch, providing any spell components or focuses that are necessary for the wearer’s spellcasting. The robe can even produce spell components or focuses with a specific cost, though it provides no more than 50 gp worth of such materials in any single day. The materials supplied by the robe are suitable only for spellcasting, and disappear if they leave the wearer’s person or when the spell requiring them is cast.","5,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-components
"Robe, Sorcerer’s","This dapper robe enables a sorcerer to add the effects of her 1st-level bloodline power to spells she casts. As a swift action before casting a spell, the wearer expends one use of her 1st-level bloodline power and selects one target of the spell to be affected by that bloodline power. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save against the spell means the bloodline power deals half damage (if it normally deals hit point damage) or is negated (if it does not). The robe can be used up to three times per day.","5,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-sorcerer-s
Sandals of the Lightest Step,"These soft leather sandals have soles that consist of a layer of purple velvet decorated with intricate gold stitching. When slipped onto the feet, they feel as weightless as air. In any round when the wearer has already moved at least 10 feet along the ground or another surface (not counting travel on a mount or vehicle), these boots can be activated as a swift action to give the wearer the ability to walk on air (as the air walk spell) until the end of the round. If the wearer hasn’t reached a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls back to the ground, taking any applicable falling damage. These sandals can be used up to 5 times per day, but no more often than once per minute.","5,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sandals-of-the-lightest-step
Scabbard of Many Blades,"This scabbard can hold multiple melee weapons in an extradimensional space, including weapons that would not normally fit in any kind of scabbard or sheath. It can hold up to four two-handed weapons. Two one-handed or light melee weapons can fit in each two-handed weapon slot, for a maximum capacity of eight one-handed or light melee weapons. Only weapons designed to be used by creatures the same size as the wearer or smaller can be kept in a scabbard of many blades. The scabbard can't be used to store shields (even if they can be used to make melee attacks), gauntlets, improvised weapons, or wands, but can store rods (which are treated as one-handed weapons) and magic staves (which are treated as two-handed weapons). When the wearer draws a weapon from the scabbard, if she does not lose her grip on it (keeping it in her hands at all times), as a move action she can have it switch places with another weapon in the scabbard. If the wearer has the Quick Draw feat, she can do this as a swift action. If the wearer loses her grip on a weapon drawn from the scabbard, that weapon can't switch places with another weapon until it has been, sheathed in the scabbard of many blades and drawn again.","5,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/scabbard-of-many-blades
School of Eyes,"This item is a flask of syrupy fluid with an eyeball floating in it. When a creature drinks the entire flask, 1d4 rounds later he is stunned for 1 round as 1d4+1 floating fish with large eyes for heads crawl out of his flesh. Once these eye-fish free themselves, they hover near the drinker, always staying in the drinker's square, and otherwise function as the eyes from a prying eyes spell, except they are Tiny rather than Fine. As long as the drinker has at least three of the fish in his square, he gains a +10 competence bonus on sight-based Perception checks. Every 1d6 x 10 minutes, 1d4+1 more eye-fish crawl out of his flesh, stunning him for 1 round each time. Each flask can produce up to 1d4+10 fish total; once this many have appeared, no more are created. The fish remain until they are destroyed or until 10 hours pass from the time the flask was used.","5,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/school-of-eyes
"Sheath, Vanishing","This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap. The sheath can accommodate any single light weapon, wand, or piece of ammunition weighing no more than 5 pounds. While sheathed, the weapon is hidden in an extradimensional space and is weightless. As a swift action, the wearer can flex her wrist, ejecting the weapon into her hand. If her hand is not empty, the weapon remains sheathed. Stowing a weapon in the sheath requires a move action. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on any Sleight of Hand check to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking the wearer in search of a weapon in the sheath. Vanishing sheaths can be worn in pairs—one on each arm. A person wearing two vanishing sheaths can eject either or both weapons with a single swift action.","5,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sheath-vanishing
Summoning Shackle,"This small silver shackle is carved with conjuration runes. When used as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less, it creates a faintly-glowing intangible magical chain from the caster to the summoned creature or creatures. The duration of that summoning spell is extended as if using the Extend Spell feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five times per day. If the shackle or the chain is dispelled, the range limitation and increased duration ends; if the spell's unmodified duration would already have ended by then, the spell ends immediately.","5,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/summoning-shackle
"Talisman, Deathbalm","A deathbalm talisman grants its wearer a +5 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against disease or poison, and if placed around the neck of an individual already suffering the effects of poison or disease, it allows a new save (with no additional bonus from the deathbalm talisman) to immediately remove the affliction. Whenever a wearer successfully saves against the effects of disease or poison while wearing a deathbalm talisman, it becomes dormant for 24 hours. After this time has passed, it refreshes and functions again. A character who wears a functioning deathbalm talisman for a period of 24 hours heals 1d4 points of ability damage to any one ability score currently suffering ability damage.","5,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-deathbalm
"Gem, Spell-Capturing","A spell-capturing gem appears as a small chunk of azurite, lapis lazuli, or turquoise. This small blue gem is imbued with the power to capture a spell and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item, the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period, the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects. A spell-capturing gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray, becoming a worthless pebble.","5,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-spell-capturing

Jingasa of the Fortunate Soldier,"This conical iron jingasa, or war hat, grants the wearer a +1 deflection bonus to AC. When struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend an immediate action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (similar to the fortification armor special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally. This ability functions only once, though the jingasa continues to grant its deflection bonus even after the other ability is expended.","5,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/jingasa-of-the-fortunate-soldier
"Vestment, Mnemonic","The surface of this delicate-looking blue silk robe is adorned with tiny embossed runes across its entire surface. If the wearer is a spontaneous caster, once per day she may use a spell slot to cast a spell from a written source (such as a scroll or spellbook) as if she knew that spell. The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script (Editor’s Note: This should probably be Spellcraft.) or read magic) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a mnemonic vestment’s properties does not consume the written source.","5,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vestment-mnemonic
