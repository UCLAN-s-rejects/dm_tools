Banner of Restful Nights,"This magical standard appears to be a rather plain banner of nondescript canvas cloth, but on command it takes on the device or pattern chosen by the person using it. Once per day when the banner is planted firmly in the ground, it creates a calm and comfortable environment in a 20-foot radius from the banner, granting those within the area the benefits of endure elements. This area of calm and comfort can even resist magical weather effects, but only if those effects are of a caster level lower than that of the banner. Also, the banner wards the area of calm and comfort as if by an alarm spell (audible alarm). The creature that plants the banner into the ground chooses the password upon doing so. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until the banner is taken out of the ground.","5,040 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-of-restful-nights
Headband of Ponderous Recollection,"This black leather headband has two small amber gemstones set so they rest on the wearer’s forehead. The headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence, but always grants ranks in a Knowledge skill. As a swift action three times per day, the wearer can call upon the headband to reveal the abilities and weaknesses of a creature within line of sight. The headband fills the wearer’s mind with information as though the wearer had made a Knowledge check with a natural roll of a 5, adding her bonuses to the check as normal. At the start of her next turn, the wearer receives additional information as though she had made the check with a natural roll of 10. At the start of her turn after that, the wearer receives a final piece of information, treating her natural roll as 15.","5,100 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-ponderous-recollection
Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic,"Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehend languages and read magic grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Linguistics checks to understand messages written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply ability to use its spells.","5,200 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-comprehend-languages-and-read-magic
Vest of Escape,"This simple silk vest looks nondescript, but is actually studded with numerous secret pockets sewn into its lining. Hidden inside these are magic lockpicks that provide a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The vest also grants its wearer a +6 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.","5,200 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-of-escape
"Belt, Plague Rat (Lesser)","This belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. Also, as an immediate action three times per day, the wearer can call upon the belt to reroll a saving throw made to resist a disease or poison. The wearer must use the second roll, even if it is worse.","5,200 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-plague-rat
Assassin's Sight (Lesser),"This black telescopic sight is made of lusterless metal and features a thick glass lens. It can be mounted on the stock of a light or heavy crossbow, but not a hand crossbow. An assassin's sight allows the wielder to make ranged sneak attacks from greater distances than normal. This sight has two settings: 0–30 feet and 30–60 feet. A character using a crossbow equipped with an assassin's sight can make sneak attacks against foes within the selected range. For example, by setting the range to 30–60 feet, a character can make sneak attacks against creatures only if they are between 30 and 60 feet of the wielder; attacks against targets closer than 30 feet or farther than 60 feet would not count as sneak attacks, even if they met all the other requirements for making a sneak attack. Setting the range on an assassin's sight is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.","5,250 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/assassin-s-sight
Tankard of the Drunken Hero,"*Note* This item is associated with a specific deity. This simple battered tankard is usually made of copper or tin. Its handle is not attached at the bottom so the bearer can hook it on his belt for easy carrying. The bearer gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will saves. Once per day, the bearer can fill the tankard with wine, ale, or other alcohol and drink from it to gain the benefits of a remove fear spell. If the associated deity is the bearer's patron, the tankard counts as a holy symbol. Once per day, the bearer can drink an alcoholic beverage from the tankard to gain the benefits of heroism. Once per day, the tankard automatically unties ropes that bind the bearer or unlocks locks that hinder him. This occurs about 5 minutes after the tying or unlocking and affects only bindings directly on the bearer's person (for example, it won't unlock a door to the bearer's prison cell, but will unlock the bearer's manacles). This power is subtle enough that it is unnoticeable unless someone checks the bindings to make sure they are secure—ropes loosen but still appear to be tightly bound, manacles unlock and loosen but do not automatically fall off. The tankard can untie or unlock only bindings with an Escape Artist or Disable Device DC of 25 or lower, though more powerful tankards may exist.","5,300 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tankard-of-the-drunken-hero
"Bottle, Eversmoking","This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered. The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.","5,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottle-eversmoking
Field Scrivener's Desk,"Pathfinders are often called upon to take notes during their adventures, but sometimes finding a place where one can write in comfort while on a mission can be rather difficult. The field scrivener’s desk attempts to address this need. This magic desk can be folded up into a 3-inch-wide cube of lacquered wood for easy transport. Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or Medium author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-foot radius hemisphere centered on the desk’s location—this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk’s tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course, the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties a field scrivener’s desk is used solely for this effect.","5,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/field-scrivener-s-desk
Headband of Ki Focus,"This tied headband helps the wearer focus his ki more effectively. Whenever the wearer spends ki points to make an additional attack, that attack roll gains a +1 insight bonus (+2 if the wearer is using a ki focus weapon with that attack). Furthermore, the wearer of a headband of ki focus is immune to the ninja’s ki block trick or similar effects that block the wearer from using ki points.","5,400 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-ki-focus
"Lens, Harvesting","This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a harvesting lens allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses. When a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by light. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding flash of light, affecting the target as a blinding ray (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again. Alternatively, a harvesting lens attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the protective penumbra spell. A vial of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a 10-foot-radius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes. This effect otherwise acts as darkness. Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work. Only one magical lens (such as this or a lens of starlight) can be attached to a telescope at a time.","5,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lens-harvesting
Stormlure,"A stormlure is usually fashioned from pieces of creatures known for their affinity to air—the feathers of birds, the shells of flying insects, and the scales of a dragon. When activated, stormlures call to the wind, causing a tempestuous gale. Once per day on command, the wearer of a stormlure is surrounding by swirling winds for 1 minute, granting a 50% miss chance against all ranged attacks, including rays and other ranged spells that require a roll to hit. This wind does not hinder the wearer of the stormlure in any way. At any one time during this duration, as a swift action, the wearer can cause the air around her to fill with crackling lightning, dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures adjacent to her. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage.","5,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stormlure
Sustaining Spoon,"If this unremarkable appearing utensil is placed in an empty container, the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although the gruel tastes like warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.","5,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sustaining-spoon
Talisman of Soul-Eating,"Worn on a necklace of vertebrae strung on a thin iron chain, this carved cacodaemon skull still bears dozens of sharp teeth. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can use the skull to draw forth the life essence of a dying or recently dead creature, as if the amulet were a living cacodaemon using its soul lock ability, creating a soul gem that appears in the skull’s mouth. The wearer or an evil outsider can ingest the soul gem as a standard action. This frees the soul within the gem, but condemns it to one of the lower planes (though the soul can be raised normally). The ingesting creature gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the eater’s Hit Dice. Draining a soul with the necklace or consuming a soul gem is an evil act.","5,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-of-soul-eating
Boots of the Vengeful Behir,"These heavy boots are made of blue leather. Three times per day, when the wearer speaks the command word, he can attempt a bull rush the following round as if one size category larger than normal. If the target of the bull rush is a dragon, the wearer is treated as if two size categories larger than normal. This bull rush attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity.","5,400 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-of-the-vengeful-behir
Necklace of Fireballs (IV),"This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Boots of Striding and Springing,"These boots increase the wearer's base land speed by 10 feet. In addition to this striding ability (considered an enhancement bonus), these boots allow the wearer to make great leaps. She can jump with a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.","5,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-of-striding-and-springing
"Fan, Wind","A wind fan appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to duplicate a gust of wind spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, non-magical tatters.","5,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/fan-wind
Metalseeker Swarm,"In its inert state, a metalseeker swarm is a heavy, 2-inch-square cube of textured steel. Once per day on command, the cube disintegrates into a cloud of countless Fine flying constructs that resemble mechanical fireflies. These fireflies cluster and flutter about in a 60-foot-radius spread around the user, homing in on Tiny or larger masses of metal and illuminating them as though the objects emitted candlelight. The fireflies continue to highlight metal objects for 5 minutes before swarming back into cube-form in the user's hand. Creatures in the area wearing metal armor are illuminated as if by faerie fire. Creatures in the area wielding metal weapons are dazzled as long as they are within range of the mechanical fireflies and continue to wield the weapons. The mechanical fireflies glow different colors depending on the type of metal they touch, though the item bears no indication of which colors correspond to what metals, so the user must figure out the fireflies' code to glean any useful information from it.","5,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/metalseeker-swarm
"Candle, Grave","Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once—the burning of a grave candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle.","5,500 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/candle-grave
"Eye, All-Seeing","This hardened, over-sized eyeball is nearly a foot in diameter. The possessor gains a +1 insight bonus on the saving throw DCs of any spells of the divination school he casts, as well as a +1 insight bonus on dispel checks made against divination effects. In addition, once per week, the possessor of an all-seeing eye can cast commune as a spell-like ability without the need for a material component. Using an all-seeing eye in this way effectively uses up its magic for a week, and the possessor does not benefit from the insight bonuses it grants until a week after commune was cast.","5,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/all-seeing-eye
Icon of Aspects,"When a cleric with an icon of aspects prepares spells, she may replace the granted powers of one of her domains with those of a different domain she doesn't have but that is associated with her deity. This lasts until the next time she prepares spells. The cleric must meet the level requirements for both abilities. For example, a 6th-level cleric with the Good domain who swaps for the Healing domain can't use healer's blessing even though she meets the level requirement, because the holy lance power of the Good domain requires her to be 8th level. The icon affects only granted powers, not domain spells, bonus feats, or other benefits. The icon can affect only one person at a time.","5,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/icon-of-aspects
Cyclops Helm,"This helm is made from the husk of a cyclops's shrunken head, and grants a limited version of that creature’s flash of insight ability.

Headband of Unshakeable Resolve,"This simple white cotton headband is decorated with a stylized imperial dragon coiled above the wearer’s forehead. The headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to her Wisdom score. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. Whenever the wearer suffers a fear effect, she may spend an immediate action to reduce the severity of the fear effect by one step. If the wearer would become panicked, she is instead frightened. If she would become frightened, she is instead shaken. If the wearer would become shaken, the effect is negated entirely.

"Pauldrons, Iron Guard","These simple, leather-strapped iron pauldrons are engraved with intricate images of icy winds and howling winter wolves. Iron guard pauldrons grant their wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against fire effects. If the wearer succeeds at a saving throw against an enemy's fire effect, the pauldrons shimmer with blue light for 5 rounds. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +5 while the pauldrons cast blue light.

Grim Lantern,"This macabre lantern is composed of a humanoid skull dangling from a short length of chain. A small fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets, casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as burning hands. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty grim lantern, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature's soul, restoring its glow.","5,800 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/grim-lantern

"Beads, Bone","This bracelet of tiny carved skulls allows its wearer to command up to 8 HD worth of mindless undead creatures as the command undead spell. It is a standard action to establish control over an undead creature, and a free action to relinquish control. If the wearer attempts to control more than 8 HD of undead, the new creatures fall under the wearer’s control, and any previously controlled undead in excess of this amount become uncontrolled.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/beads-bone
Belt of Foraging,"This belt allows its wearer to easily forage while in the wilderness. As long as the wearer of this belt has at least 1 rank in Survival, he need not make a check to get along in the wild; he always succeeds at that Survival check as long as he moves at half his overland speed. He can still choose to make that check to provide food and water for one other creature for every 2 points by which his result exceeds DC 10. Furthermore, he can instead make a DC 20 Survival check to get along in the wild while moving at full speed instead of half speed.

"Bracelet, Verdant Vine","Consisting of a vine with five green berries, a verdant vine is worn tied around the wrist. Once per day on command, the wearer can pinch a berry off the vine, and throw it up to 30 feet away, like a splash weapon. Viciously thorny vines erupt in a 20-foot radius from the point of impact, even if the berry misses its target. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or become entangled, as the spell entangle, as the vines coil around the creature’s legs. The vines persist, but at the start of the affected creature’s turn, it gains a new saving throw against the effect. If the affected creature fails the saving throw, it also takes 1d4 points of damage. A DC 20 Strength check, made as a standard action, allows an affected creature to break free and end the effect. Failing the check causes the vines to constrict, dealing 1d4 points of damage.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/verdant-vine
"Bracers, Bonebreaker","These thick brass and leather bracers allow the wearer to tear through bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer can activate the bracers to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the bracers reduce the target's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer’s choice) by –6. This penalty cannot reduce the target's ability score below 1. The injury heals over time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the time of the injury, and is immediately removed by heal, regenerate, restoration, or any magic that can break a curse.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/bracers-bonebreaker
Cloak of the Scuttling Rat,"This unassuming cloak initially appears to be made of plain leather. When the wearer speaks the command word, however, the cloak of the scuttling rat wraps itself around her, transforming her into a dire rat as if using beast shape I.

When struck in combat, the wearer may spend one use as an immediate action to create a longsword-shaped spiritual weapon that then attacks her attacker. On the wearer's next turn, she may spend one additional use each round to continue attacking that target with the spiritual weapon; the spiritual weapon cannot be redirected and disappears if the target is killed or moves out of range.

Fan of Autumn,"This delicate fan is made of dried leaves and thin twigs. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can wave the fan to summon forth a 30-foot cone of swirling red and gold leaves that lasts for 3 rounds. This area acts as obscuring mist, except for the duration and the fact it is composed of leaves rather than fog (thus, creatures able to see through mist and fog can't see through the fan of autumn's concealment).

Fortifying Leeches,"This ornate glass jar is filled with greenish fluid and the slick, writhing forms of many large black leeches. Though bloodmages often use leeches to help them regulate their overloaded circulatory systems, this particular batch adds additional benefits usable by anyone. To attach this jar's leeches, the user merely needs to open the jar and upend the contents over his head and torso as a standard action—the leeches do the rest, attaching to the user's body almost instantaneously. These leeches impart a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, but also a –4 penalty on Diplomacy checks against creatures that might find such a practice grotesque (such as most civilized races). Once applied, the leeches persist for 8 hours before they die. The leeches are immediately destroyed if the wearer takes more than 20 points of damage from any area-effect energy damage. The jar automatically refills with a new batch of fortifying leeches after 24 hours. While the fortifying leeches are applied, a bloodmage immediately regains 2 bonus points to her blood pool—this cannot increase her blood points to higher than her normal maximum. In addition, whenever the bloodmage uses her bleed ability to gain extra blood points, she may roll her bleed dice twice and take the more favorable result.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/fortifying-leeches
"Gloves, Magnetist’s","These thin leather gloves have delicate steel wires running through them. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of these gloves may attempt a disarm combat maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target’s item must be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the target is disarmed and the item falls to the ground in the target’s square. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer’s square, the wearer may attempt to catch the item with a DC 10 Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer’s square. The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one hand free. If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check, she is not disarmed.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-magnetist-s
"Goggles, Storm","These goggles, made from a pair of smoky crystal lenses set in an adjustable leather strap, help the wearer see through storms of rain, snow, or even dust. A pair of storm goggles fully negates any Perception penalties imposed by a natural storm or atmospheric condition. Also, once per round when the wearer makes an attack against a target that has concealment from him because of natural or magical fog, mist, clouds, or vapor, the wearer can choose to roll the miss chance percentile twice and take the better of the two results.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goggles-storm
Horn of Battle Clarity,"The call of this hollowed-out animal horn rallies nearby creatures to battle. When the horn is blown, all creatures within 60 feet who have not yet acted in combat are no longer considered flat-footed. The horn has no effect on other conditions or abilities that treat a creature as flat-footed. A barbarian who sounds a horn of battle clarity may spend 2 rounds of rage to act as if she had the superstition rage power for the remainder of that battle.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horn-of-battle-clarity
Horseshoes of a Zephyr,"These shining, silvery horseshoes bear designs of swift-moving clouds and anthropomorphized images of the wind. When affixed to a horse, these horseshoes allow the horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that the horse can cross non-solid or unstable surfaces such as water and that it can move without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horseshoes-of-a-zephyr

This light allows the holder to work in all manners of darkness, including magical darkness, unimpeded and without attracting the attention of other creatures. This light does not provide enough illumination to see anything beyond a single lock or similar device on which the tools are used. As they glow, the tools vary their color, indicating favorable or unfavorable positioning within a device. These guiding lights grant a +5 circumstance bonus on Disable Device checks.","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lockpicks-luminous
Mask of the Mantis,"These red masks cover the entire face. A mantis mask has three daily charges.

Pipes of Haunting,"This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune.

"Shadow Piercings, Eye (Minor)","These piercings may penetrate the eyebrow, eyelid, or the eye itself. Due to magical, they do not impair the owner's vision.

"Shroud, Dead Man’s","This dirt-stained cloak was woven in shadow from the burial shroud of a condemned murderer. It prevents nonintelligent undead from detecting you, as per the hide from undead spell. Intelligent undead can perceive you if they succeed at a DC 11 Will save. The warding is ended if you touch an undead creature, channel energy against undead, or attack any creature. Once per day as a standard action you can silently call forth the shadows bound into the shroud, rendering you invisible for 5 minutes.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/shroud-dead-man-s
Singing Bell of Striking,"This simple bowl-shaped bell made of either cold iron or silver is played by rubbing a leather mallet along its rim, creating a ringing sound. By playing the bell while meditating or resting to regain ki, the bearer may attune his ki points to the instrument. Once attuned, the bearer's ki strikes count as cold iron (if the bell is cold iron) or silver (if the bell is silver) instead of magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points. A creature can only be attuned to one singing bell at a time, and a singing bell can only be attuned to one person at a time. Only creatures whose ki strikes normally act as magic weapons can use a singing bell of striking.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/singing-bell-of-striking
Spiral Tiles,"This item is associated with a specific deity. These 10 ebony, pearl, and ivory tiles, when arranged in a spiral pattern on the ground, provide you with the effects of a guidance spell once per day. The spell’s effect lasts until discharged. If you worship the associated god you can toss the spiral tiles upon the ground once per day as a standard action and interpret the patterns they lie in as if you had cast augury. If you do not worship the associated god and you attempt to use spiral tiles in this manner, the result is either random or purposefully misleading.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spiral-tiles
Steelbone Frame,"This gear-jointed, metal exoskeleton can be affixed to or removed from a suit of medium or heavy armor in 10 minutes. While attached, the enchanted frame bears some of the armor's burden, reducing the armor's check penalty by 2.

Stone Familiar,"This life-sized carving of a Tiny animal is crafted from dark, rough stone. It has a hardness of 8 and 20 hit points. A witch can use the stone familiar to store up to 500 levels of spells (cantrips count as 1/2 level for this purpose). A witch can use the stone familiar to teach her living familiar any spells stored in it, and vice versa. A witch who identifies a stone familiar immediately knows what spells are stored inside it.

Symbol of Luck,"This translucent sphere of iron-hard glass changes shape to match its bearer's holy symbol within an hour of coming into her possession.

It is normally decorated with the symbol or heraldic device of the owner, and may be trimmed with expensive and delicate materials (such as silk, fur, or cloth of gold). Once per day, the wearer of the tabard may say its command word (often a family motto); thereafter, the wearer can spend a standard action (instead of a full-round action) to move up to his speed and make a single charge attack. This ability lasts until used or for 1 minute, whichever duration is shorter.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tabard-crusader-s
"Tattoo, Caster’s (Lesser)","A caster’s tattoo is infused with potential magical energy that aids in casting spells that normally utilize verbal and somatic components. Once per day, a spellcaster may activate her caster’s tattoo as a swift action to automatically enhance the next spell she casts in that round with both the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. When she casts the spell, the caster’s tattoo flares with light for a moment, then grows faint and faded—it replenishes its energy in 24 hours, after which it becomes bold and colorful and can be used again. Required material components or foci must be in the creature’s possession to cast the spell (and are consumed as normal), but need not be held when the spell is cast. Allows the modified casting of a spell of up to 3rd level.","6,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-caster-s
Tunic of Deadly Might,"This tunic is crafted from golden thread, and has silver-hemmed sleeves. The wearer gains a +2 bonus to Combat Maneuver Defense against disarm and sunder combat maneuvers.

"Vest, Deadshot","This rough vest of black snakeskin is decorated with a fringe of rawhide tassels, each knotted around a bit of bone or a small animal skull. A gunslinger with the deadeye deed reduces the grit point cost to use that deed by 1 (minimum 1 grit). In addition, once per day when the wearer reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm she can use death knell (Will DC 13 negates) against that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch the target to activate this ability, but her range increment penalty for shooting the target also applies to the saving throw DC of the death knell (for example, if the range increment penalty is —2, the DC is 11).","6,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-deadshot
Burrower's Bridle,"This metal-studded bridle can be attached to any creature with a burrowing speed that is made friendly or helpless. The bridle grants anyone who mounts the bridled creature a +4 competence bonus on Ride, Handle Animal, and wild empathy checks to control the bridled creature. An equipped burrower's bridle allows the user to calm and train (with Handle Animal or wild empathy) any creatures with a burrow speed and an Intelligence score of less than 3—not just animals or magical beasts. The bridle also allows a creature riding a burrowing creature to accompany it underground while it burrows, but does not grant the ability to breathe underground.","6,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/burrower-s-bridle
"Cloak, Treeform","This long green cloak’s back features an embroidered image of an ancient oak.

Coin of the Untrodden Road,"When tossed into the air, this tarnished copper coin brings forth potential lost by life's decisions. If a human, half-elf, or half-orc flips the coin and catches it, she takes a -2 penalty to the ability score modified by her +2 racial ability score bonus, but gains a +2 inherent bonus to a random other ability score. The bonus and penalty last for 1 hour. Negating the penalty automatically negates the bonus as well. The coin can be used three times per day.","6,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coin-of-the-untrodden-road
"Harness, Eidolon Anchoring","Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness. When worn by an eidolon, the bindings act as a dimensional safety harness, anchoring the outsider to its current plane. Any time the eidolon would be forced to return to its home plane (such as when it’s reduced to negative hit points equal to its Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend one use of its summoner’s summon monster spell-like ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious for the eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the summoner is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the eidolon is forced back to its home plane). If the condition that would have sent the eidolon back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the eidolon may expend another use of its master’s summon monster spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane","6,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/harness-eidolon-anchoring

Martyr's Tear,"This imperfect, rose-tinted gemstone resembles a teardrop or a broken heart depending on its orientation. Its pale facets are typically marred by a single crack or chip near the gem's middle. Once per day, the bearer may spend a standard action to transfer 3d6 hit points from himself into the gem. This deepens the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating more life energy stored in it. The gem can store a maximum of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in the gem, the bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard action, transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to the target creature, healing it a number of hit points equal to the amount stored in the gem. This returns the gem to its normal color.","6,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/martyr-s-tear
Master's Squeeze-Box,"This concertina was created by a notorious bard. It can be used like a masterwork concertina, providing a +2 bonus on Perform (keyboard instruments) checks. At any one time, the squeeze-box is either more compressed than extended or more extended than compressed, and switching between the two is a free action (and in fact, happens regularly when the instrument is played). When the concertina is compressed and held in a hand, the wielder gains the compression ability. When the concertina is extended and held in a hand, the wielder is immune to constriction damage (as from constrict attacks) and damage from being buried, although the wielder gains no protection from suffocation.","6,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/master-s-squeeze-box
"Necklace, Fey Child","This necklace is set with a bloodstone sculpted to look like a scintillating green eye. It gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based checks made to interact with gnomes, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with beings of the fey creature type, and a —2 penalty on similar checks when interacting with anyone else. The wearer can read, speak, and understand the Gnome language. If the wearer is not a gnome, she gains low-light vision, and may cast dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation, and speak with animals each once per day as a spell-like ability.","6,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necklace-fey-child
Rope of Knots,"This rope is 100 feet long and can perform all the functions of a rope of climbing. Furthermore, upon command the rope of knots snakes out and knots itself into a rope structure. The rope can tie itself into any structure which can be created out of 100 feet of rope. Possible structures include (but are not limited to) a sturdy rope bridge up to 25 feet long, a 10-foot-square net or hammock, or a 40-foot-tall rope ladder. The rope takes up to 10 rounds to create a complex structure or half that time to return itself to a simple coil. The rope has hardness 1 and 20 hit points.

Torc of The Primal Song,"This heavy gold neck ring resembles a braided rope. When the wearer performs a raging song or benefits from an ally's raging song, she gains the Diehard feat for the duration of the song. In addition, she benefits from any helpful raging song or bardic performance for 1 round after the performance ends or would normally cease affecting the wearer. This does not stack with other means of prolonging the effects of a performance that has ended.","6,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/torc-of-the-primal-song

Life Link Badge,"When this plain leather badge is sewn onto a summoner's armor or clothing, a faded image of his summoner rune appears on its surface. The summoner can add charges to the badge by expending summoner spell slots; the badge gains charges equal to the spell level of the slot expended (maximum 5 charges). Adding charges to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended). When the summoner uses his life link ability, instead of sacrificing his own hit points, he may expend charges from the badge to heal the eidolon 1d6 hit points per charge. The summoner does not have to decide how many charges are spent beforehand (he may expend one charge, roll, and decide whether or not to spend more charges for more healing).

Book of Extended Summoning (Greater),"This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply the Extend Spell feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a metamagic rod for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal book of extended summoning can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment.

Necrograft (Gravespawn Gland),"A gravespawn gland is a piece of zombie brain implanted in the host's skull. When the command word (which is often kept secret by its creator) is spoken within 60 feet of the host, the gravespawn gland releases a surge of necromantic power, dealing 4d6 points of negative energy damage to the host. The host must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by breath of life or raise dead. A creature killed by a gravespawn gland rises 1 round later as a mindless zombie. A gravespawn gland is rarely implanted willingly. Unlike with most necrografts, implanting this organ requires a successful DC 25 Heal check by the necrograft surgeon, not a successful Fortitude save by the recipient. Removing an implanted gravespawn gland requires a successful DC 25 Heal check; if this check is failed by more than 5, the gravespawn gland detonates inside the host.","6,200 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necrograft

Whistle of Calling,"This whistle emits a loud, shrill note. Once per day when the user blows this whistle his mount or animal companion is instantly teleported to a safe space of the user's choice that's within 30 feet of him. The creature must be within 1 mile, and any effect that bars or hampers teleportation also impedes this effect.

Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold.

Horn of Goodness/Evil,"This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment.

Horn of Plenty,"This hollowed-out horn comes in four varieties: a horn of plentiful goods, a horn of plentiful labor, a horn of plentiful influence, and a horn of plentiful magic. Each variety carries the same construction requirements but offers a different benefit. The horn’s type must be determined at creation and cannot later be changed. If the horn is random, roll a d4 to determine which type of horn it is. A horn of plenty may be blown once per week of downtime to improve the rate at which its bearer can exchange capital. On command, a horn of plentiful goods, labor, or influence allows a creature to trade any 2 points of a single type of capital in exchange for 1 point of either Goods, Labor, or Influence, as indicated by the item's name. (For instance, a horn of plentiful goods allows a creature to trade 2 points of any one kind of capital for 1 point of Goods.) This effect lasts for 1 day. If you are already trading two single types of capital for one other type of capital, at the GM’s discretion, blowing the horn allows you to trade on a 1-to-1 basis.

The muzzle harmlessly clatters to the ground and returns to ball form if it fails to strike a creature or no creature is present in the space in which it landed, and it does not return to its thrower. A creature muzzled with an instant muzzle cannot speak properly (if it was normally able to do so), and gains a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it attempts to cast with verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly use a command word when activating a magic item. The muzzled creature cannot make bite attacks or even drink or eat properly. The muzzle has hardness 10 and 25 hit points.

Trumpet of Spirit Speaking,"This long, segmented cone is made of a lightweight metal and collapses into three sections. Although non-magical spirit trumpets are most often used by fraudulent mediums and manipulated with sleight of hand and ventriloquism, a trumpet of spirit speaking allows actual communication with the spirits of the deceased. Once per day, when its mouthpiece is placed to the lips of a mostly intact corpse, the user can ask up to three questions of the dead creature, as if the corpse were subject to a speak with dead spell. The corpse's replies to the questions issue forth from the horn in quiet, ghostly whispers.","6,500 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trumpet-of-spirit-speaking

Naga-Scale Bindi,"This shining, jewel-like scale is usually worn on the forehead between the eyebrows, though a creature can affix the scale to any part of her body by pressing it to her skin and speaking its command word.

Truefaith Vestments,"This +1 chain shirt appears as a fine hooded robe made of silk of a color appropriate to the wearer's rank within his or her church as if it had the glamered special ability (it appears white when worn by anyone who doesn't follow the Living God). Used primarily as a means of appearing to be protected by the false god's power, the armor is treated as a +3 breastplate against attacks made by any enemy who has not seen through the illusion.

Used this way, the cape bestows a +1 insight bonus to AC and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. Readying the cape in combat is a move action; if the wielder has a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, the wielder can ready the cape as a free action as part of movement.

Whenever the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder falls asleep, the roosters decorating the wayfinder change to crescent moons. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the wayfinder's bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the noisemaker wayfinder immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as there is a clear line of effect between the wayfinder's bearer and the triggering creature. The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm. When the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves.

"Cape, Eagle","Large eagle feathers decorate the back and arms of this magnificent cape. Should the cape’s wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a feather fall spell for the wearer only. Once per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle (as per the beast shape I spell, except that it allows only eagle form and the wearer gains the eagle’s full fly speed of 80 feet). This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be ended prematurely as a standard action.

The hat grants a +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge checks to identify monsters. If the wearer is an investigator, the hat allows him to take advantage of his deductions in combat. Whenever he uses inspiration to identify a nonhumanoid creature, he can record the result of the inspiration die and use it again later. Within the next minute, before rolling an attack roll against that creature, a skill check against that creature, or a saving throw against one of that creature's attacks, he can add the recorded inspiration die result to his roll—if he does so, he can't use inspiration to apply another inspiration die to the roll. Using the recorded result doesn't require the investigator to spend a use of inspiration, and the recorded result goes away once it's used. He can have only one inspiration die result recorded in this way. If he uses inspiration to identify another monster before using his recorded inspiration die, he must decide whether to replace the old result before rolling.","7,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hat-investigator-s
Horn of the Golden Draught,"As a standard action, this gold-plated drinking horn can produce a golden draught. A creature that imbibes or is anointed with this liquid is freed from enchantments, transmutations, and curses as if subjected to a break enchantment spell. If the user suffers from no such conditions, her skin instead takes on a golden hue and becomes almost impervious to blows, as per stoneskin.

Mirror of Guarding Reflections,"Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem ghostly and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result. If the attack does not strike the image, the image fades away at the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used three times per day.","7,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mirror-of-guarding-reflections
Orb of Arcane Research,"Made of a glassy, translucent substance, this orb swirls with the eldritch energy of spellcasters long departed. When the bearer researches a spell to create a new spell or learn an existing one from another source, this orb provides a +2 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks. Additionally, when the command word is spoken, an orb of arcane research allows its bearer to gain a +5 insight bonus on a Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nature), or Spellcraft check made to research a spell or extract formula. The orb can be used five times in this way before the item cracks, losing all of its magical properties and reverting to a piece of mundane glass.","7,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-arcane-research
Robe of Useful Items,"A character who dons this battered robe notes that its patches rearrange into the shapes of various helpful but mundane items. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches: Dagger, Bullseye lantern (full and lit), Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror), Pole (10-foot length), Hempen rope (50-foot coil), Sack. In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature. (d%) - Result: (01–08) - Bag of 100 gold pieces; (09–15) - Coffer, silver (6 in. by 6 in. by 1 ft.), 500 gp value; (16–22) - Door, iron (up to 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. high and barred on one side—must be placed upright, attaches and hinges itself); (23–30) - Gems, 10 (100 gp value each); (31–44) - Ladder, wooden (24 ft. long); (45–51) - Mule (with saddle bags); (52–59) - Pit, open (10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.); (60–68) - Potion of cure serious wounds; (69–75) - Rowboat (12 ft. long); (76–83) - Minor scroll of one randomly determined spell; (84–90) - War dogs, pair (treat as riding dogs); (91–96) - Window (2 ft. by 4 ft., up to 2 ft. deep); (97–100) - Portable ram.

Armiger's Panoply,"An armiger's panoply is a magic item set made up of one pair of bracers and a large leather sack. The bracers are normally forearm guards made in the style of masterwork padded or quilted cloth armor. They are often made of silk or high quality linen, though they can also be crafted of leather or even chain links. A command word is normally inscribed on the inside of one of the bracers. The sack can be used to store a single suit of armor, including a shield. The armor retains its normal weight when stored. If items other than a suit of armor and a shield are put in the sack, they immediately fall through. Three times per day, the wearer of the bracers can speak the panoply's command word to have the suit of armor and shield stored in the sack teleport onto the wearer. The sack must be within 500 feet of the wearer of the bracers in order to function. If the wearer is already in a suit of armor, it is teleported into the sack at the same time the new armor is teleported onto the user's body. As long as the armor to be worn is the same size as the user, it fits perfectly and doesn't interfere with anything else worn or hindering the user, including any grapple or tight space the wearer might be trapped in.","7,200 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/armiger-s-panoply
"Boots, Jaunt","These stylish black leather boots are stitched with images of winding roads and trails through peaceful orchards. They can be worn up to mid-thigh, or have their cuffs turned down to make knee-high boots. Three times per day, as a move action, the wearer can move up to 15 feet (or her movement speed if it’s less than 15 feet). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.","7,200 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-jaunt
"Bracers, Longarm","These bracers are constructed from woven strands of bamboo. Three times per day, as a swift action, the wearer can stretch her arms beyond their limits, increasing her reach by 5 feet until the start of her next turn. Her weapon attack rolls take a —4 penalty, while unarmed strikes and natural weapons using the arms take no penalty.","7,200 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/longarm-bracers
Carcanet of Detention,"Comprised of thick iron links, the carcanet of detention is commonly worn by prison guards and elite members of the city watch. Once per day, the wearer of the carcanet may command it to animate and attempt to wrap around one Medium or smaller creature within 15 feet. The target receives a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid the chain. If the saving throw fails, the target is entangled and cannot move from its current location. As a full-round action, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; otherwise it persists for 10 minutes or until ended by the wearer as a swift action, at which point it returns to its carcanet form. The chain has a hardness of 10 and 15 hit points.","7,200 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/carcanet-of-detention
Gloves of Marking,"These ruddy leather gloves enhance the precision of the wearer. When wielding a piercing or slashing weapon and using Weapon Finesse, the wearer can mark a creature when confirming a critical hit instead of dealing additional damage. The mark consists of a simple symbol, such as a single letter. The wielder and her allies gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against the marked creature for 1 minute. In addition, the marked creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the wielder's level + the wielder's Dexterity modifier) or be shaken for 1 minute. The bonuses and condition persist even if the damage caused by the mark is healed.","7,200 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-marking
Mask of the Krenshar,"This simple leather mask depicts an earless catlike creature. When worn, it melds into its wearer’s face and vanishes, leaving the wearer’s face just as it looked before. Three times per day the wearer can command the mask to appear to retract the wearer’s skin, revealing an illusion of the wearer’s glistening skull and musculature. Creatures within 100 feet who see this display must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the target has more than 6 HD) for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a glamer. Anyone who can see through illusions (such as by true seeing) is unaffected.","7,200 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-of-the-krenshar

"Boat, Folding","A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.","7,200 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boat-folding
Cloak of the Manta Ray,"This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time, the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the beast shape II spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray. The cloak does allow the wearer to attack with a manta ray's tail spine, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired.","7,200 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-the-manta-ray

Bottle of Air,"This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment, it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.","7,250 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottle-of-air
"Barding, Featherleaf","This enchanted sleeve is made of tiny, feather-shaped leaves and is designed to fit birds. Once fitted over the body of a Tiny or smaller avian creature, featherleaf barding automatically shrinks to snugly fit the creature's torso and neck, serving as +1 leather armor (granting a total bonus to AC of +2). The maximum fly speed of a creature wearing featherleaf barding is 60 feet with average maneuverability. In forests, jungles, and thickly wooded areas, the wearer can fly through branches, brush, and even whole tree trunks as if they weren't there, though its fly speed and maneuverability remain the same.","7,310 ",9,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/barding-featherleaf
Bag of Holding (III),"This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. It can hold 1000 lbs. in 150 cubic ft.. If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. ** Editor's Note: Bag of Holding refers to the space inside as 'non-dimensional' whereas the rules on extradimensional spaces explicitly refer to bags of holding as examples of extradimensional spaces. **","7,400 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding
"Bag of Devouring, Intelligent","Statistics: [  Alignment chaotic evil; Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 13, Ego 13 (17 against any non-demon); Senses 30 ft., blindsense; Languages speech (Abyssal)  ] Most bags of devouring appear as normal sacks, but this one is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a fabled creature it refers to as the Eater of All. The bag hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction. It has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers. [  ** Bite: As a standard action, it’s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. The bag (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite it’s Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder’s abilities; ** Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of the bag, the bag’s cursed aura imparts a –1 penalty on all of its wielder’s attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If the bag manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.  ] Construction requirements match a Bag of Holding (Type III)","7,400 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-devouring-intelligent
Boots of Levitation,"These soft leather boots are incredibly light and comfortable, with thin soles reinforced by strips of tough hide that provide an unexpected amount of support and protection to the foot.

"Cloak, Hunter’s","Usually made from the skins of giant serpents, these cloaks are designed to help rangers, hunters, and trackers blend in with and travel quickly through the areas they are most familiar with. If the wearer has the favored terrain class ability and is traveling through one of his favored terrains, he can transform himself into an animal native to that environment. This works identically to the beast shape I spell, save that it is limited to creatures native to the environment (as defined in the appropriate Bestiary entry or per the GMs discretion).

The left and right halves may be separated and worn individually, allowing two people to see through one another’s eyes. When separated, the wearer of either half of the goggles may speak a command word to see through the lens of the other half, so long as the halves of the goggles remain within 500 feet of one another.

Harp of Charming,"This beautiful and intricately carved harp can be held comfortably in one hand, but both hands are required to utilize its magic. When played, a harp of charming enables the performer to work one suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 Perform (string instruments) check.

"Mask, Plague","This stylized bird mask consists of a pair of goggles attached to a ceramic beak that covers the nose and mouth.

One-Way Window,"When not in use, this magical device appears to be a simple wooden picture frame about 3 inches by 5 inches in size. However, when set against a solid surface, it becomes a window, allowing the user to see through to the other side. No visible evidence of the window appears on the opposite side of the wall or door where it is used. No items, light, sound, spells, or spell effects can pass through the window, and divination magic that allows the user to penetrate illusions or spot hidden things (such as true seeing) does not function. If there is no ambient light in the area being viewed, it appears as complete darkness to the viewer. The one-way window can penetrate up to 1 foot of wood, 6 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal. If the surface to be looked through is too thick, the frame simply doesn't function. It can't be used to peer at mechanical structures behind thin veneers (such as the tumblers of a lock); it can only show open spaces beyond the barrier it is placed against.","7,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/one-way-window

Balm of Impish Grace,"When rubbed vigorously into the skin, this potent red liniment enhances a Tiny or smaller creature's ability to make full use of its size and mobility. Applying a dose of liniment is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to applying an oil). A creature under the effects of the liniment no longer provokes attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares or for entering a larger creature's square.

Boots of Swift Fury,"These boots of heavy, furred hide rise to the wearer's calf, and are held in place with rough hide straps secured by thick iron buckles. They increase the wearer's base land speed by 10 feet (considered an enhancement bonus).

Candle of Clean Air,"This clean-smelling white candle is inscribed with glyphs portraying various sweet smelling flowers. When lit, the candle repels smoke, mist, cloud, and other gas effects in a 5-foot radius. These effects do not penetrate the area around the candle if they are of spell level 3 or lower. Against more powerful cloud effects (including effects not based on spells, such as dragon breath or a gorgon's breath weapon), the candle grants creatures in the area a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against these effects. Creatures in the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from creatures with the air subtype. The candle burns for up to 5 minutes, in increments of 1 minute.

"Collar, Spell-Sharing","This thick leather collar is studded with onyx gems and fastened with a simple metal clasp. Spell-sharing collars come in a variety of sizes and can be secured around the neck of any creature capable of wearing and using a neck-slot item. They are usually sold in sets. A creature with the share spells ability (such as an animal companion or familiar) wearing a spell-sharing collar can benefit from that ability with any other creature wearing such a collar that is attuned to its own collar, rather than gaining the benefit only with its bonded master. Attuning two or more spell-sharing collars takes 10 minutes, during which time the collars must be touching one another. A spell-sharing collar can have as many as three other spell-sharing collars attuned to it at once.

Cups of Rapport,"These wooden drinking cups are similar to those found in many common taverns, and always come in pairs—one is a master cup, and the other is a mark cup. When a user of the master cup shares drinks with someone with the mark cup, the master cup's user gains a supernatural advantage when attempting to develop a good rapport with the creature drinking from the mark cup. After 5 minutes of sharing a drink and chatting with a user of the mark cup, the user of the master cup gains a +5 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks against the user of the mark cup.

Vambraces of the Tactician,"These vambraces change their appearance depending on who wears them. If the wearer is a cavalier, these vambraces display the symbol of his order. When unworn or in the hands of a non-cavalier, they appear to be an ordinary pair of steel vambraces. A cavalier wearing these vambraces is considered two class levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his challenge class feature. Furthermore, once per day as a swift action, a cavalier with the tactician class feature can increase the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end of his next turn, when the cavalier grants his allies a teamwork feat, he can grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they must still be able to see and hear him.","8,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vambraces-of-the-tactician

While the wearer has such a creature grappled or pinned, it cannot use any shape-changing spells or abilities unless it succeeds at a concentration check; the DC of this check is 4 + the DC of casting the spell while grappled. If the wearer has such a creature pinned, a successful grapple check allows him to force the target into a specific shape it can take naturally (without the use of a spell). This involuntary transformation only forces the creature into a shape it is normally capable of and does not cost the creature an action.","8,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gauntlets-form-fixing
"Gem, Metamagic (Quickening Diamond)","Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a full-round action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action). The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created—their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding unique gemstone type associated with it.","8,000 ",11,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-metamagic

Three times per day, the gloves allow the wearer to treat a ranged magus spell as a spell with a range of 'touch,' allowing him to deliver the spell with his spellstrike ability. The glove can only affect spells that normally affect one or more creatures at a range greater than 'touch' (such as slow), not rays or other created effects. The altered spell only affects the creature attacked (any other targets normally allowed by the spell are lost).","8,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-spellstrike

Unintelligent undead automatically can't see you, and intelligent undead receive a single DC 12 Will save to notice you despite the stone's effects.

Retriever Drone,"A retriever drone appears as a masterfully preserved spider the size of a house cat, whose eyes have been replaced by four glittering gemstones. These devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers, since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand. A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30 feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours. If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone—this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust. As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 16 negates).","8,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/retriever-drone
Runestone of Power (2nd),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 2nd level.","8,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1
Sandals of Interception,"These simple wooden sandals allow their wearer to step in the way of danger to protect her allies. Three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer can take a 5-foot step to move into the path of a ranged attack and treat herself as the target of the ranged attack that passes through her square for the purposes of Deflect Arrows, Snatch Arrows, Missile Shield, and other feats and abilities that allow her to deflect ranged attacks. If she lacks a feat or ability that would allow her to deflect the ranged attack, the wearer is instead simply struck by the attack regardless of the attack roll's result or her AC. The wearer can't take a 5-foot step during the turn after using this ability.","8,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sandals-of-interception
Deck of Illusions,"This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. a full deck consists of 34 cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.) <see d20pfsrd site for the table>. A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11–100 on d%), but may be discovered (01–10) with 1d20 of its cards missing.

Necklace of Fireballs (VI),"This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

"Ropes, Razored","A razored rope is a +1 lasso made out of tightly braided lengths of fine chain, used to help restrain cowards attempting to flee a battle. It can be used to entangle an opponent as normal, but deals 1d4 points of damage to a creature that attempts to slip free and fails. The razored rope is also more difficult to escape from, requiring a DC 18 Escape Artist check to slip free from and a DC 28 Strength check to break. If your patron is a god of battle, as a standard action you can cause the lasso to constrict around a creature already entangled by the rope, dealing 1d4 points of damage.

Candle of Invocation,"Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on Attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame. A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him As if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts And the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties. In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process.","8,400 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/candle-of-invocation
Bag of Tricks (Rust),"This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following table to determine what animals can be drawn out of each. (d%) - (Animal): (01–30) - (Wolverine); (31–60) - (Wolf); (61–85) - (Boar); (86–100) - (Leopard).

As a move action, the wearer can travel on the backs of the rats as they swim, moving up to 15 feet across the surface of calm waters. If surface conditions become worse than calm, the rats disperse and the wearer falls. On land, the swarm allows the wearer to ignore difficult terrain's effects on her movement for up to 15 feet of movement per round. The swarm can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. If the wearer falls unconscious while rat-tread boots are active, on the wearer's next turn the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible, the swarm disperses. The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space. The swarm disperses when the effect's duration ends or when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. Rat-tread boots grant the wearer immunity from the attacks of rat swarms, including their special attacks.","8,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-rat-tread

Some bear the hair of actual nightmares along their rims, causing them to occasionally flare and crackle with flames reminiscent of the foul equines. When the wearer runs or charges, smoke issues up from the boots, acting as concealment (20% miss chance) when the wearer provokes attacks of opportunity while making those actions. Secondly, three times per day, as a swift action, the wearer can make the boots smoke, which grants her concealment until the end of her turn. Lastly, once per day, when the wearer hits a creature with a melee attack, she can command the boots to ignite.

Cape of Daring Deeds,"The wearer can spend a full-round action concentrating to change the color of this short, silken cape to match any attire or mood. When using the derring-do 1st-level swashbuckler deed, the wearer adds an additional die when rolling either a natural 5 or 6 rather than just a natural 6. Additionally, the cape grants a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +4 for 1 round each time the wearer uses the charmed life swashbuckler class feature.","9,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cape-of-daring-deeds
Investigator's Pipe,"This long-stemmed, wooden pipe can burn any number of substances, but is primarily used for smoking tobacco. The pipe smoker can command a small, smoky servant to emerge from the pipe to do minor tasks. The servant can move or fetch small objects, and in general acts as an unseen servant, except that it is visible as a small, wispy cloud of gray smoke. Additionally, the servant is capable of clearing one 5-foot square of smoke or fog per round. The servant can be used for up to 1 hour per day; this time doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 10-minute increments. An investigator gains some additional benefits while smoking the pipe. He can use inspiration on Survival checks to track or Perception checks to notice fine details without spending a use of inspiration. Additionally, once per day he can attempt a Knowledge check as if he had the eidetic recollection investigator talent.","9,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/investigator-s-pipe
Loathsome Mirror,"This buckler-sized mirror magnifies flaws and faults, presenting the least appealing image of any creature reflected in it. The mirror must be held in one hand to function. As a standard action three times per day, the bearer of the mirror can project a reflection onto the creature that produced it, making them appear utterly loathsome to all onlookers. The subject must be within 30 feet of the mirror, and must be able to see the mirror to be affected. For the next 5 rounds any creature attempting to target the subject with a beneficial spell or effect must make a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature must choose a new subject for the spell or effect is wasted. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can target the subject normally for the remainder of the mirror's effect's duration.","9,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/loathsome-mirror
Veil of Fleeting Glances,"In addition to hiding the face, this fine lace veil protects the wearer against gaze attacks. The wearer has a 50% chance to avoid making a saving throw against a gaze attack even when not averting her eyes. If the wearer averts her eyes, she rolls twice (once for the veil, once for averting her eyes) and uses the more favorable result. Against patterns, visual figments, and other vision-based effects and attacks that cannot affect blind creatures, the veil grants the wearer a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws. The veil does not otherwise impede the wearer’s vision in any way.","9,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/veil-of-fleeting-glances

Decanter of Endless Water,"If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type of water as well as the volume and velocity. [  “Stream” pours out 1 gallon per round; “Fountain” produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round; “Geyser” produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.  ] The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d4 points of damage per round from the geyser rather than 1d4. The command word must be spoken to stop it.","9,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/decanter-of-endless-water
"Gloves, Glyphbane","These dark-brown, leather gloves are etched over their entire surface with arcane insignia. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Disable Device checks made to disable magical traps. Once per day, if the wearer’s check to disarm a glyph, rune, or similar writing-based magical trap exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she may change the trigger condition of the trap instead of disabling it. The new trigger condition must be one allowed by the magical trap; for example, a glyph of warding cannot be set according to class, HD, or level, even when manipulated by the gloves.","9,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-glyphbane
"Horseshoes, Nightmare","These horseshoes are made of blackened steel and are typically stamped with infernal symbols or, less subtly, horrific images of terrified and tortured steeds of the darkest hues. They typically give off a slight smell of brimstone, as though they had been crafted in some hellish forge. On command, the mount’s rider may grant it the smoke supernatural ability. The horseshoes can be used for 10 rounds per day, split up as the mount’s rider chooses (minimum 1 round per use). While this power is activated, the mount’s eyes, hooves, mane, and tail burst into flame, and its hooves deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage.","9,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horseshoes-nightmare
Necklace of Adaptation,"This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.","9,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necklace-of-adaptation
"Bead, Boro (3rd)","This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any one 3rd level extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. A bead works on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or non-magical alchemical material such as antitoxin.","9,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bead-boro
Candle of Abaddon,"Molded from a pale, milky green wax into the shape of a column of screaming souls, and stamped on the bottom with the unholy symbol of one of the Four Horsemen, the candle of Abaddon is a boon to evil spellcasters, but also to any who would summon or interact with daemons. When burned, the candle sheds eerie illumination in a radius of 15 feet, similar to Abaddon’s perpetual eclipse. A spellcaster within the radius of the burning candle gains a +2 bonus to caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as a magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Within the light, all creatures take 1 point of damage per round, natural healing doesn’t work, and magical healing requires a DC 24 caster level check to succeed. A candle normally burns for 4 hours, and any burning consumes at least 1 minute of its power. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn’t interfere with its magical properties.","9,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/candle-of-abaddon
Page of Spell Knowledge (3rd),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 3rd level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","9,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (3rd),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 3rd level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.","9,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power
Spell Lattice (3rd),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","9,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Serpentine Owl","This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties.","9,100 ",?,?,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/serpentine-owl-figurine-of-wondrous-power
"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Black Jade Raven","This fist-sized piece of black jade is exquisitely tooled into the shape of a raven with outstretched wings. Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have Improved Steal as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for “yes” and twice for “no.” The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments.

Silverfang,"Silverfang is a +1 undead bane mithral rapier originally forged by a cabal of vampire hunters in as a weapon against their hated foes. Ironically, the rapier was claimed by a powerful vampire as a trophy after he single-handedly slew the entire cabal during their foolish attempt to destroy him. Since then, the weapon has been bequeathed as a token of his favor to no fewer than a dozen vampiric thralls and five of his dhampir children. As long as Silverfang is carried, the user gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against negative energy and level drain, and whenever he makes a Fortitude save to recover from a negative level, he may roll the save twice, taking the better of the two results as the actual result. Once per day, Silverfang can target an undead creature it just successfully critically hit with a halt undead effect (Will DC 14 negates) as a swift action.","9,320 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/silverfang
Gloves of Pulverizing Disruption,"Three times per day, the wearer can use these thick leather gloves to make a melee touch attack against an undead creature, a construct, or a non-magical object and deal 3d4 points of damage to it. When the wearer deals damage in this way, the gloves absorb part of the matter that makes up the target. This creates dust that is stored within the gloves for 24 hours. The next time the wearer attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver, the dust flies from the gloves, providing a +2 bonus on that attempt. If the wearer does not attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver before 24 hours elapses, the dust disappears.","9,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-pulverizing-disruption
"Belt, Monkey (Lesser)","This furry brown belt resembles the tail of a monkey. The belt grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not lose his Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing, and does not take a —5 penalty on Climb checks when climbing at half his speed. As a swift action the wearer can command the belt to animate, transforming it into a prehensile tail under the wearer’s control. The tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects about as well as the wearer’s normal limbs (though any activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail’s capabilities). The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive.","9,400 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-monkey

"Beads, Prayer (Strand) (Lesser)","This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list. [  (Bead of blessing) - Wearer can cast bless; (Bead of healing) - Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease.  ]. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. Each special bead can be used once per day. The bead of blessing functions as spell trigger items. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

Brilliant Bulwark,"This +1 blinding buckler is made from a lustrous glass that is as hard as steel and reflects light like a mirror. The shield glows as a torch, though this light can be suppressed or resumed on command. The shield can be commanded to shine light as per daylight for up to 10 minutes each day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The wielder can also expend this duration while activating the buckler’s blinding ability to increase the save DC by 1 for every 2 minutes of daylight duration expended. The shield must sit in natural bright light for at least 1 hour after its 10 minutes of daylight is expended before the ability can be used again.","9,655 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/brilliant-bulwark

For wearers with the raging song class feature, it grants the use of inspire courage and inspire competence as a 4th-level bard by spending rounds of raging song. In addition, each poet's cloak allows its wearer to grant one specific rage power when using raging song in place of his own rage powers (if any). The specific rage power varies by cloak.

"Bracelet, Seducer’s Bane","This slender silver bracelet is worked in an intertwined design of three flowers. A DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identifies the flowers as acacia, apocynum, and bilberry, symbolizing concealment, treachery, and falsehood. The bracelet grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks, and a +5 resistance bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell incorrectly senses the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the bracelet’s wearer knows an enchantment targeted him and the enchantment’s source. Seducer’s bane creates an aura on its wearer, visible to detect magic, matching the failed enchantment spell or effect, and lasting as long as the intended enchantment’s duration. However, if the bracelet’s wearer attacks the caster or its allies, or otherwise acts in a way that’s contradictory to the failed spell’s effect, the caster of that spell immediately realizes the enchantment was ineffective.","9,900 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/seducer-s-bane
