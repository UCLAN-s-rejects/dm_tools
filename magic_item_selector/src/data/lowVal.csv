Firepowder,"This chalky yellow powder is usually kept in a finely woven canvas pouch. When you mix firepowder with fine sand, the resultant mixture quickly heats up until it combusts, creating a slow-burning flame that requires no additional fuel. Half a pound of firepowder takes 1 minute to mix, and the fire produced burns for 8 hours, equivalent to a standard campfire.",10 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/firepowder
"Ioun Stone, Dull Gray Stone","These are ioun stones that have been burned out or otherwise rendered all but powerless. They retain the ability to float and orbit, and are useful as the target of spells such as continual flame, daylight, and silence, allowing you to keep your hands free.

Caltrop Bead (Iron),"The wielder may throw this small, dense iron sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) or use it as a sling bullet. Upon striking a solid object, a caltrop bead explodes into caltrops in a 10-foot-radius burst. A creature directly hit by a caltrop bead takes 2d4 points of piercing damage, and adjacent creatures take 1d4 points of damage as the bead suddenly bursts.

"Dye, Truecolor","Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer—the viewer’s good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye’s nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.",50 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/truecolor-dye
Sentinel Scorpion,"This crystalline hand-sized scorpion figurine is so full of cracks and occlusions that it looks as if it could fall apart at any minute. As a standard action you may throw the sentinel scorpion to the ground, causing it to explode into crystalline shards that cover the ground in a 10-foot burst. When any creature steps in the area, the shards make popping sounds as loud as the audible version of the alarm spell. A creature moving in the area of the shards has a 10% chance each round of stepping on the stinger. The stinger injects Large scorpion venom and is treated as a trap (Perception DC 20, Disable Device DC 20). After 2 hours, the shards decay into harmless powder.",50 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sentinel-scorpion

Wound Paste,"Prized by slavers as an affordable way to stop a captive from bleeding to death, a dose of wound paste acts as a stabilize spell when slathered on a dying creature. Applying wound paste is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A pot of wound paste contains 5 doses.",50 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wound-paste

"Paint, War Paint of the Terrible Visage","This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has enough material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one creature's face. Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly mélange of colors, making his appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see his painted face within 30 feet to be affected by cause fear (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint's magic; otherwise it fades away.",100 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/paint-war-paint-of-the-terrible-visage
Stubborn Nail,"This adamantine piton is 6 inches long. As a standard action, the bearer may push the nail by hand into any non-living material, including metal, stone, or wood. The bearer may push it through more than one item at a time, so long as the total thickness is not greater than the length of the nail. Once pushed into place, the nail is held firmly as if it had been hammered there (a DC 20 Strength check to remove it), although the creature who put it there can remove it as a move action. Once removed, the nail leaves no hole or other sign of its presence. The nail can support 500 pounds. If used to hold a door shut, increase the break DC of the door by +2. If pressed into a lock, the lock cannot be opened until the nail is removed. Once removed, the nail loses all its powers and transforms into a non-magical iron piton.",100 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stubborn-nail
"Canard, Raucous","The raucous canard appears to be a small, nondescript piece of rolled-up parchment. Unrolling the parchment, however, allows you to record up to a 25-word message. Once you record a message, you may throw it into the air, causing it to animate, sprout small feathery wings, and circle overhead for 10 minutes while loudly repeating the message over and over in a bland, genderless voice. Alternatively, you may close the scroll, and the next person to open it triggers this animation. After 10 minutes, the raucous canard disappears in a small shower of sparks. Scheming nobles like to use these to spread gossip about their enemies.",100 ,1,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/canard-raucous
Elixir of Last Will,"If a character drinks this gray liquid, the next time (within 24 hours) he falls below 0 hit points, he exhales a sliver of his consciousness—whether he is alive or dead. If a character drinks multiple elixirs in a 24-hour period, only one is effective. As an immediate action, the sliver can guide the action of one ally within 30 feet of the drinker's body. This guidance gives a +2 luck bonus on that ally's next attack roll, to the ally's AC against the next attack made against her, or on the ally's next skill check. The drinker decides the type of bonus and the ally. The bonus must be used within 1 round.",150 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-of-last-will
Elixir of Love,"This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become enraptured with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as charm person—the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The charm effect wears off in 1d3 hours.",150 ,4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-of-love
Elixir of Repression,"A draught of this pale blue liquid imposes a dull placidity upon the imbiber, making him less quick to anger while not significantly impairing his mental functions. A drinker with homicidal or other antisocial tendencies can dull his more extreme urges with regular doses of this elixir, allowing him to blend into society without resorting to murder, assault, or other actions that might make day-to-day life difficult. Additionally, the elixir gives the imbiber a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against any mind-affecting spell or effect. As a side effect, the imbiber must succeed at a DC 13 Will save to benefit from spells and effects that grant a morale bonus. An imbiber who is afflicted with any form of madness receives a +4 insight bonus on any saving throws made to resist the effects of that madness during the elixir's duration.

Unguent of Timelessness,"When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper, or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as four Medium objects.",150 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/unguent-of-timelessness

"Gloves, Assisting","The wearer of these simple gloves can speak a command word create a glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action, the wearer can have the hand assist him with a task as if using the aid another action. The hand uses the wearer’s base attack bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another is successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer’s ability scores or other bonuses). The hand remains until it has attempted one action or until 1 minute passes, whichever comes first, at which time the gloves become non-magical.",180 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-assisting

Bandages of Rapid Recovery,"These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest regardless of activity. A creature actually receiving long-term care (from the Heal skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day.

"Cape, Catching","This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.",200 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cape-catching
Formula Alembic,"This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion or alchemist extract into the knowledge needed to create its formula. By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion. Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn).",200 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/formula-alembic
Hybridization Funnel,"This two-spouted funnel is used to safely mix two alchemical splash weapons into a single flask. Using the vial requires 10 minutes and a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check; a half-elf has a +5 bonus on this check. Failing the check means both splash weapon are destroyed. Success means the two materials are safely mixed into one vial that is the same volume as a normal splash weapon vial; when thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has the effects of both component substances and creatures are affected as if hit by both. The mixture becomes inert after 24 hours. Only liquids may be mixed with the funnel. The bearer can use it to mix an alchemical splash weapon with either holy water or unholy water, but the Craft (alchemy) DC increases to 30; half-elves still get the +5 bonus on this check. The funnel does not work on potions, elixirs, extracts, or other materials. Mixing a substance with a similar or identical substance (such as alchemist's fire with alchemist's fire) has no effect. A mixture cannot be combined with another mixture.",200 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hybridization-funnel

Soul Soap,"This small bar of coarse gray soap has tiny pieces of ash, coal, or hard earth embedded in it, making the use of the soap uncomfortable and leaving anyone washed with it as dirty as before. Washing a creature with the soap requires water and takes 1 minute, after which the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw against any hostile ongoing mind-affecting effect currently affecting it. Unwilling creatures must be pinned or otherwise made helpless before they can be washed. The soap is sufficient to wash one creature.",200 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/soul-soap
Trollbane Blanch,"Originally developed by huldras for hunting trolls, this green-gray paste is stored in a tree bark jar in order to mask its pungent odor, for trolls recognize its scent immediately and often flee from it, or attack the bearer in preference to all other targets. When applied to a weapon as a full-round action, a dose of trollbane blanch causes the weapon to deal 1 additional point of fire damage or acid damage (the type of damage is chosen when the blanch is created) on its next successful attack. Once applied, trollbane blanch lasts for 1 minute or until the wielder makes a successful attack.",200 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trollbane-blanch

Corpse Puppet,"This crudely carved wax doll is roughly humanoid in shape. If the bearer of a corpse puppet dies while in an alternate form (such as that of a shapechanger using her change shape ability, a caster using a polymorph spell, or one obtained through some other effect), the creature automatically retains the shape it had upon dying instead of reverting to its natural form. Creatures with reason to suspect deception can attempt a DC 12 Will save; if successful, they realize the unnatural state of the corpse.

Dust of Tracelessness,"This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been Abandoned and disused for a decade. A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical Aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.",250 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-of-tracelessness

Traveler's Any-Tool,"This implement at first seems to be nothing but a 12-inch iron bar lined with small plates and spikes. It can be folded, twisted, hinged, and bent, to form almost any known tool. Hammers, shovels, even a block and tackle (without rope) are possible. It can duplicate any tool the wielder can clearly visualize that contains only limited moving parts, such as a pair of scissors, but not a handloom. It cannot be used to replace missing or broken parts of machines or vehicles unless a mundane tool would have done the job just as well. The any-tool counts as a set of masterwork artisan's tools for most Craft or Profession skills (although very specialist crafts such as alchemy still require their own unique toolset).

"Cinder, Jumping","This piece of sooty coal has a tiny bit of flint embedded in it. The bearer of a jumping cinder can, as a standard action, order it to burst into flames and bounce around in random directions. Each round, the jumping cinder leaps into a randomly selected adjacent square. If a creature is in the square into which the jumping cinder lands, that creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage if it fails a DC 12 Reflex save. After 1 minute, the jumping cinder burns out, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a tiny smear of ash. Some goblin tribes use jumping cinders to randomly select volunteers for undesirable duties from a large crowd of goblins—anyone who takes fire damage from the jumping cinder but is not killed by the fire has to do the undesirable task.",300 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cinder-jumping
"Dust, Escape","When a handful of this coarse, crystalline powder is thrown at a single creature, it circles around that creature and disrupts its ability to attack and see. Using this dust requires a ranged touch attack by its user (with a range increment of 5 feet), but doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. On a hit, the target is dazzled and cannot make attacks of opportunity or immediate actions for 1 round.",300 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/escape-dust
Origami Swarm,"This stiff folded paper vaguely resembles a hand-sized pest such as a beetle, spider, or cockroach. Completing two key folds in the paper causes it to multiply into hundreds of similar-sized duplicates of itself. These duplicates fill a 10-foot space and act as a rat swarm, except they have fire vulnerability, the construct type, and do not have the disease special ability. The paper beetles do not attack their creator, but are otherwise uncontrolled and attack anything nearby. After 5 rounds, the beetles crumple and fall inert. Once activated, an origami swarm loses all magic.",300 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/origami-swarm
Trapped Beverage,"This brightly labeled bottle or waterskin could appear to contain any number of different beverages, from absinthe to wine. However, it's actually a magical trap, and when the bottle is opened, a spider swarm pours out. The swarm stays in the area for 3 rounds, then disappears. Detecting that the bottle is trapped requires a successful DC 25 Perception check made by a character with the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC 25 Disable Device check. After being triggered, the trapped beverage remains a mundane bottle or wineskin.",300 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trapped-beverage

"Lamp, Salt","A salt lamp appears as nothing more than a fist-sized chunk of pink, white, or green quartz-like rock. In reality, the “rock” is compressed salt mined from areas infused with strange magical radiations.  When you speak the command word, the salt lamp lights up with a glow equivalent to a torch. The salt lamp becomes warm, though never uncomfortably hot, to the touch. The salt lamp glows for 1d4+1 hours before its light fades out and it becomes ordinary salt. At any time while the salt lamp glows, you can hurl it at the floor, causing it to explode into a cloud of glimmering salt crystals that form a 10-foot radius cloud. The cloud continues to shed light as a torch, as well as visibly outlining invisible objects within the cloud. Shining salt particles cover anyone within the area and adhere and glow for the remainder of the lamp’s duration. The salt particles cannot be removed by normal means, but they can be dispelled. Any creature within the cloud, or covered with the salt particles, takes a –40 penalty on Stealth checks.",350 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lamp-salt
Alluring Golden Apple,"This enchanted apple appears to be made of solid gold. When dropped or thrown, it draws the attention of the nearest hostile creature within 20 feet. The creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be paralyzed as if by hold person as it focuses its undivided attention on the golden apple. If the creature makes its save on a later round, it realizes it has been affected by magic and the apple is not actually gold. While focusing on the apple, the target takes a —2 penalty on Perception checks. The apple is consumed upon being dropped or thrown.",400 ,4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/alluring-golden-apple
"Bell, Gremlin","From rural villages to bustling cities, many blame even the slightest misfortunes on the depredations of gremlins. Regardless of whether such creatures are truly to blame for a community’s problems, many shrines and hedge wizards sell tiny charms to their neighbors, talismans meant to ward off lesser evils: gremlin bells. Crafted from bronze, brass, or countless other semiprecious metals, these miniature bells — no more than an inch tall — hang from delicate chains or short silken cords and ring with a tinny tinkling. Typically affixed over doorframes or to precious objects, when rung frequently these ornaments supposedly ward off gremlins and protect those nearby from ill fortune. And unlike most such folk magic, expertly made gremlin bells actually work. Gremlin bells have two uses. First, they irritate gremlins. Any gremlin that comes within 20 feet of a gremlin bell cannot make use of any of its supernatural abilities and becomes uncomfortable, typically seeking to leave the area (though it is not compelled to do so). Secondly, once per day a gremlin bell can be purposefully rung. All gremlins within 20 feet who can hear the chime must make a DC 16 Will save or be sickened for the next 5 minutes.",400 ,2,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bell-gremlin
Haunt Siphon,"These glass vials are held within stylized cold-iron casings etched with strange runes, necromantic designs, or other eldritch markings. Within the vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex of air. To capture a haunt’s energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)—this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt’s area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt’s hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green—if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a –5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the haunt siphon hits takes 1 point of negative energy damage from the splash.",400 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/haunt-siphon
Key of Lock Jamming,"This ornate brass key automatically reshapes itself to fit any standard keyhole (generally those in doors scaled for use by Small or Medium creatures, not deliberately oversized locks like the main door to a dwarven fortress). Once placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, 8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC. Touching the key and speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate, leaving the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again.",400 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/key-of-lock-jamming
Toothpick of Pyrotechnics,"This simple wooden toothpick is useful for creating flashy diversions on stage or in a fight. Breaking the toothpick causes a blinding flash and a dark cloud of smoke to appear. Creatures other than the user within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud of smoke spreads 20 feet in all directions, obscures all sight (including darkvision), and lasts for 3 rounds.",400 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/toothpick-of-pyrotechnics

Displacing Stone,"Upon activation, this pulsing white pebble creates an instantaneous burst of reverse gravity, which clears a 5-foot-diameter sphere of any loose stone or earth. The displacing stone then holds the affected stone or earth in place, keeping a collapsed tunnel clear for 1 minute. Once the duration ends, the loose earth collapses if it’s not supported. Displacing stones are destroyed when used, and don’t affect living creatures.

"Coin, Minder’s","This simple copper coin establishes a connection with the most recent person to keep it under her tongue for 24 hours.

Dimensional Acid (Basic Pit),"The acid in this flask burns not through matter, but through space itself, creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively, it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid.

Animated Portrait,"This 4-foot-by-6-foot framed painting is a detailed portrait of a particular intelligent creature, animated to show movement or action within the painted scene. The image reacts when questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer and responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with no actual intelligence, but is programmed with up to ten 25-word verbal responses and can respond to questions if these responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the programmed responses is the name of the person shown in the portrait, it can answer questions such as 'who are you?' and 'what is your name?'

If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular question (if she does answer, she must tell the truth).

"Key, Clockwork","A clockwork key has two uses, but one functions only if your patron is a good god. Constructs avoid attacking the bearer of the clockwork key, directing their attacks toward other targets if possible, unless they are directly threatened by the bearer or are ordered by their creator to attack. If there are no targets other than a clockwork key’s bearer, a construct will act and attack as normal. If your patron is a good god, you can use the clockwork key as an improvised weapon that deals 1d2 points of damage. If you strike a construct with a clockwork key, it takes 1d4 points of damage and must make a DC 12 Will save. If the construct fails, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.

Orbicular Sac,"Breaking open this magically enhanced spider egg sac (a standard action) conjures a massive spider web in a square adjacent to the user. The web is 5 feet thick and up to 20 feet wide and high. The spider web is nearly invisible; spotting it requires a successful DC 20 Perception check in bright light. This DC increases by 4 for every step below bright light in which the spider web is placed. This effect otherwise acts as the web spell (DC 13). Alternatively, the user can enhance a web created by another orbicular sac. Each additional sac increases the duration of the web by 30 minutes and the Reflex and grapple DCs by 2 (maximum increase of +10).",500 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orbicular-sac

When you coat your hands with the resin, you gain the ability to sculpt sand as per the stone shape spell, but you cannot create items with moving parts and must sculpt the shape by hand. One use of resin allows you to shape up to 15 cubic feet of sand, requiring 1 minute per cubic foot sculpted. Sand shapes that cannot support themselves naturally (such as arches or overhangs) collapse after 1 hour, but stable shapes like thick walls or mounds persist indefinitely, barring vandalism or erosion. Once applied to your hands, the resin’s power lasts until you have sculpted 15 cubic feet of sand or 1 hour has passed.",500 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/resin-sandsculpt

The vest feels soft to the touch and springs back into shape no matter how badly compressed. Its magic keeps the vest fresh and whole despite constant wear and abuse.

Bottled Misfortune,"This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green liquid. As a full-round action, a witch can target the bottle with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid.",500 ,10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottled-misfortune

"Grease, Mundanity","This slippery, jet-black goo has a consistency comparable to warm lard. A bottle of mundanity grease can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When an animal companion, a familiar, or another bonded creature is struck by mundanity grease, the bond to its master is temporarily suspended. The creature and its master lose any of the following abilities they have from the companion or familiar bond: deliver touch spells, devotion, empathic link, evasion, improved evasion, link, scry on familiar, share spells, speak with animals of its kind, spell resistance, and speak with master. For the duration of the effect, a familiar originally of the animal type is treated as an animal (rather than a magical beast) for the purposes of determining which spells affect it. This effect lasts for 1d4 minutes or until the grease is washed off the affected creature by magical means.",500 ,11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/grease-mundanity
Sinner's Wage,"A sinner's wage is a round golden coin with two blank faces. When placed among non-magical currency, it adopts the size, shape, and any embellishments (such as an engraving or stamp) of the majority of the other coins. When included as payment for any service that compromises the recipient's morals (such as a bribe for a lawful city guard to look the other way, or a contribution to a good politician to pass dubious legislation), a sinner's wage makes the offered payment more tempting. The giver of the sinner's wage gains a +2 profane bonus on Charisma checks and Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince the recipient to perform the service in question. Thus, the item can be used to pay off a guard as well as convince an outsider to perform a service with a planar binding spell (in the latter case, the +2 profane bonus stacks with the bonus normally granted for offering a reward to the outsider). In addition, a sinner's wage can be used as an optional focus component when the owner casts any charm or compulsion spell of 5th level or lower. When a creature is subject to a spell incorporating this focus, it takes a –2 penalty on all rolls to resist acting against its nature (whether a Will saving throw or a Charisma check). Using the sinner's wage in this fashion temporarily drains the magic from the coin, rendering it unusable for any purpose for a period of 1 week.",500 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sinner-s-wage

Seer's Tea,"This rich tea can be made from any number of herbs. When the tea is brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read the patterns in the leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup, gaining the benefits of an augury spell.

"Book, Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer","This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death — though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again. The Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer is affected by a permanent magic aura that makes it appear to be nonmagical.",600 ,3,Faint,

When tossed into the air, the dust can cover a chamber with up to 100 square feet of floor space, and illuminates all footprints made within that space in the last 24 hours. Illuminated footprints glow softly for 1 hour after the dust is sprinkled and grant a +20 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to follow the tracks. A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail or road illuminates footprints in the same way, and can span as much as 250 feet. Evidentiary dust cannot reveal footprints of creatures that hid their trail via effects such as dust of tracelessness or a druid's trackless step.",600 ,4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/evidentiary-dust
"Dust, Storyteller's","This dust is kept in gaudy bags, but is a simple white powder. When thrown into a fire, it conjures a visible theater of the mind (as minor image) within a 10-foot cube above the flames. The user can manipulate this illusion, which lasts for 2 hours or until the user banishes the scene. The user gains a +2 bonus on all Performance checks to tell a story using the image created by the dust.",600 ,2,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-storyteller-s
Abjurant Salt,"Carried in a tube of beaten silver, this rough-ground salt is a powerful defense against evil conjurers. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the salt can be poured in a circle with a diameter of 5 feet or a straight line up to 15 feet long. While the line of salt remains unbroken and undisturbed, evil summoned or called creatures cannot physically cross it or interfere with it. These creatures can continue to make ranged or magical attacks over the line. Any other creature may disturb the line simply by scuffing it. The effects of the salt last as long as the line remains unbroken. Once laid, the salt cannot be recollected.",600 ,9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/abjurant-salt

"Feather Token, Tar and Feathers",Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. a particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed—even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance. // This token can be directed to float to any point within 60 feet and then burst into a mass of sticky white feathers that adheres to all creatures in a 10-foot radius. The clinging feathers affect creatures in the area as a glitterdust spell.,600 ,12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/feather-token/tar-and-feathers-token

Poison Popcushion,"This squishy, gel-filled sack is the size of a fist, and its exterior is covered with countless tiny metal studs. When set on the ground or somewhere else within line of sight, a poison popcushion can be targeted with a melee or ranged attack (hardness 0, AC 7). A successful attack causes the poison popcushion to explode, sending a spray of needles everywhere within a 10-foot-radius burst and dealing 1d4+1 points of piercing damage to creatures caught in the area each round for 1d3 rounds. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves this damage. Additionally, a poison popcushion can be loaded with an injury poison before it is placed. Fully loading a poison popcushion takes 3 doses of poison (not included in the price). In addition to dealing damage, a loaded poison popcushion affects struck creatures with the poison stored within, though the Fortitude save DC to save against this poison is 4 lower than the poison's usual DC.",700 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/poison-popcushion
Globe of Moonlight,"Silvery, pearlescent light seeps out of this skull-sized glass orb. When shattered (a standard action), the globe floods a 30-foot radius burst in moonlight. Creatures that are affected by the light of the full moon (such as an afflicted lycanthrope) are affected as if exposed to such light, and effects that rely on moonlight function within range of this effect. This moonlight persists for 1 minute, is treated as dim light (replacing any current illumination in the area), and is equivalent to a 4th-level light spell for the purpose of interacting with other light or darkness effects.",700 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/globe-of-moonlight
Swarm Bullet,"This small brass cylinder is inscribed with a symbol of a honeycomb, and a faint buzzing sound can be heard from within. A swarm bullet can be loaded into a weapon with the scatter weapon quality, such as a blunderbuss, as though it were ammunition. When fired, the weapon produces a wasp swarm that immediately moves to attack the nearest living target in a 15-foot cone. The wasp swarm acts on the shooter's turn each round, pursuing the closest living creature for 3 rounds or until it's destroyed. Should the weapon misfire while loaded with a swarm bullet, the swarm instead angrily emerges from the weapon and pursues the wielder.",700 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/swarm-bullet
"Bead, Campfire","This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a small (2-foot-tall) pile of burning logs whenever its command word is spoken. The fire burns for 8 hours or until extinguished, at which point it turns back into a bead. The owner of the item must wait twice as long as the fire burned before he can order the bead to become a campfire again.",720 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bead-campfire
Archon's Torch,"This torch is made of pale yellow wood and inscribed with holy runes. When lit, it burns as a regular torch, but only lasts for 5 minutes. When held by a lawful good creature, it functions as an archon's aura spell. The magical aura ends if a lawful good creature isn't holding it, and resumes automatically if a lawful good creature holds it again.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/archon-s-torch
Assassin's Dust,"This fine dust causes bare skin that it comes in contact with to burn and tingle. When sprinkled on a corpse or an inanimate skeleton, it causes the dead flesh and bones to disintegrate into a fine brown powder similar to that left by a disintegrate spell. Assassin's dust comes in a small vial suitable for treating eight Small corpses, four Medium corpses, or one Large corpse. A skeletal corpse counts as half a corpse of its size. This dust has no effect on living or undead creatures.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/assassin-s-dust
"Canopy, Travel","This 5-foot-square cloth canopy is brightly colored with gold fringe around the edges, something a slightly foppish sultan might use while resting on the seashore. When you speak the command word, the canopy unfolds and floats 3 feet above your head, positioning itself to keep you shaded. The travel canopy cannot hold any weight. It reverts to its 1-foot-square folded form at your command, or automatically when it is out of the sun for more than 1 minute.",750 ,7,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/canopy-travel

Greensurge Bomb,"A greensurge bomb is a small magically and alchemically treated plant bulb with a root growing out of that forms a handle. The bomb can be thrown like a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When the bomb strikes the ground, it bursts open, scattering weeds in a 10-foot radius. At the beginning of the thrower's next turn, the weeds rapidly grow into thick undergrowth, creating an area of difficult terrain. The weeds flourish regardless of the surrounding natural terrain (even in urban settings or on hard rock floors) but don't grow on damaging surfaces, such as pools of lava or acid. The new vegetation lasts for 5 minutes before it turns brown and crumbles to dust.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/greensurge-bomb
Iron Rope,"When the end of this gray hemp rope is held and the command word is uttered, it is irrevocably transmuted into solid iron. The transmuted rope loses all magic and has the hardness and hit points of a normal inch-thick iron bar. When crafted, the rope is 25 feet long, but can be cut up to three times and each section of rope can be commanded to harden individually.",750 ,4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/iron-rope
Levitating Land Mine,"Once the command word is spoken, this steel disc burrows 3 inches into the ground. To find it, a character with the trapfinding ability must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. Planting the mine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once the mine is set, any creature that steps into its square must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or the mine levitates the creature 5 inches above the ground. A levitated creature can attack but not move, is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers. Flying creatures are immune. The creature can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. The effect ends after 5 rounds, with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, or with a successful saving throw. The land mine is destroyed when the effect ends.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/levitating-land-mine
Snapleaf,"This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. While falling, the bearer can snap and destroy the snapleaf as an immediate action to gain the benefits of feather fall and invisibility. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/snapleaf
Thoqqua Snake,"When burned, this firework produces smoke as a smokestick. It also expands into a tube of ash that, after 1 round, takes the form of a thoqqua. The thoqqua attacks the user's opponents to the best of its ability. If the user speaks Ignan, she can direct the thoqqua to not attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. After 5 rounds or when it is reduced to 0 hit points (whichever comes first), the thoqqua collapses into a pile of non-magical ash.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/thoqqua-snake
Trapped Puzzle Box,"Solving this simple kinetic puzzle involves removing several pegs from a handheld wooden cube. However, removing the final peg triggers the magical trap. The box explodes in the victim's hands, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 for half damage). Detecting that the box is trapped requires a successful DC 30 Perception check made by a character with the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC 30 Disable Device check.",750 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trapped-puzzle-box
"Elixer, Honeytongue","Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber a +10 bonus on Bluff checks made to convince another that her words are the truth. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes, and doesn't apply to any other use of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a secret message via innuendo. If a magical effect is used against the honeytongue elixir's imbiber that would detect her lies or force her to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed at a DC 16 caster level check to compel the elixir's imbiber to tell the truth. Failure means the effect doesn't detect the imbiber's lies or force her to tell the truth.",750 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixer-honeytongue
Stalagmite Seed,"These dense pebbles are sometimes used by drow skirmishers for both offense and defense. If a stalagmite seed is thrown, it has a range increment of 20 feet. If it's slung, treat it as a sling bullet. If the attack misses, roll for misdirection as if it were a splash weapon. When a stalagmite seed strikes a natural stone surface, a stone stalagmite immediately emerges where it landed, filling the 5-foot square and growing to 10 feet in height. Any creature occupying the square takes 5d6 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Any creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save takes half damage and is not knocked prone.",750 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stalagmite-seed
Book of Extended Summoning (Lesser),"This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply the Extend Spell feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a metamagic rod for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal book of extended summoning can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment. Once the book is used, it crumbles into cold ash and is destroyed.",750 ,17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-of-extended-summoning
Polish of Inconspicuous Armor,"This pungent, tar-black armor polish comes in a small circular tin. One dose is enough to apply to a single Medium suit of armor or two Small suits of armor. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during which time the user must visualize a normal set of clothes or another set of armor—an alternative appearance for the armor to take on. After it is applied, the polish's noxious scent dissipates and the armor appears in the way the user visualized, as the glamered magic armor special ability. The armor maintains all properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, armor check penalty, and maximum Dexterity bonus. This effect remains for 24 hours before wearing off.",750 ,5,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/polish-of-inconspicuous-armor
Belt of Tumbling,This thin and flexible cotton cord is meant to be wrapped several times around wearer’s waist.

Bottled Yeti Fur,"This small opaque flask releases a thick stream of coarse white fur when opened. This fur creeps up the user's arm and across her entire body until she is completely covered in a tangled pelt. While coated with this fur she gains cold resistance 5, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks in areas of ice and snow. This fur sheds from her body after 24 hours, or can be removed early by soaking it in alcohol. The flask is expended after one use.",800 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottled-yeti-fur
Cap of Human Guise,"This threadbare hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance at will as with a disguise self spell, except she can only appear as a plainly dressed Small human child, adult halfling, or adult gnome, such as a peasant, blacksmith, or shopkeeper. The wearer can slightly alter the cap’s appearance as part of the disguise, but otherwise must match the overall unremarkable look of the illusory form. Though invented and primarily used by Small humanoids, it can be used by any Small or Medium humanoid creature.",800 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cap-of-human-guise-1
Defoliant Polish,"This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by defoliant polish with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack.",800 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/defoliant-polish
Demon Blood,"A character who drinks a dose of this black, bubbling ichor becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds if he fails a DC 15 Fortitude save. He also gains an enhanced capacity to affect demons with his magical attacks for 1 hour—during this time, demons suffer a –2 penalty on their saving throws against the user’s spells and spell-like abilities, and the user gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to penetrate a demon’s spell resistance. Demon blood is somewhat addictive, and every day for a week after a user stops daily doses of the ichor, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1 point of Wisdom damage and being sickened for the entire day.",800 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/demon-blood
Dust of Emulation,"A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact with any one item or object as if she had successfully used the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a class feature or race (if the exact result of the check matters, treat the character's result as a 25). If the user of the dust does not mentally select the intended item or object while coating herself with the dust, the magic of the dust applies to the first eligible object she encounters. She can apply the result of this automatic check when dealing with the item or object for 1 hour after exposure to the dust.",800 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-of-emulation
Hat of Human Guise,"This threadbare hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a disguise self spell, except she can only appear as a plainly dressed Small human child, adult halfling, or adult gnome, such as a peasant, blacksmith, or shopkeeper.

Infiltrator's Onyx,"These gems always come in pairs—one white onyx and one black onyx. The white onyx has an aura of faint divination, while the black onyx is non-magical. The black onyx gem on its own is worth 50 gp as a spell component for animate dead and similar spells. If the black onyx is used as a material component in a necromancy spell, the bearer of the white onyx receives a mental alarm. This alarm reveals the direction of the paired black onyx gem as long as it is within 1,000 feet, as locate object. This effect lasts for 5 minutes. If the owner of the white onyx gem is within 1 mile of the black onyx at the time the necromancy spell is cast, the owner may destroy the white onyx as a standard action. Doing so also destroys the black onyx, making it unsuitable for use as a spell component and ruining the necromancy spell. The destruction of either onyx gem immediately ends the alarm and locate object effects. The white onyx turns gray and crumbles to dust after the locate object effect ends. More expensive sets of these gems exist; black onyx gems in such variant sets are worth up to 1,000 gp or more. The value of the black onyx gem is added to the item's construction cost.",800 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/infiltrator-s-onyx
Ranged Piton,"This pointed metallic piton bears a ring the size of a gold piece. A ranged piton is sized and designed so that it can be launched as easily as an arrow. When fired from a bow as a standard action at an object or empty square, the wielder makes a ranged attack against AC 5 to determine whether the piton hits the intended target. Range penalties apply as normal. On a hit, the piton attaches to the point struck, cleaving to vertical and horizontal surfaces alike. An attached ranged piton can be recovered only by speaking a command word while pulling on the piton's ring. Light rope, such as silk rope, can be threaded through the piton's ring before it is fired to rapidly place rope lines.",800 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/ranged-piton
"Stalactite, Portable","This miniature stone stalactite measures 4 to 5 inches long. As a standard action, you can toss a portable stalactite up to any solid surface no more than 20 feet above, whereupon the portable stalactite automatically affixes to the ceiling. If no suitable ceiling exists, the portable stalactite falls at your feet. Once affixed, the portable stalactite remains in place until you call it back to your hand (a standard action) or until a living creature (except you) walks under it, at which point it drops from the ceiling and makes a +10 attack roll against the target. If it hits, it deals 1d6+1 points of damage. You can affix as many portable stalactites as you like to an area’s ceiling, but you must leave at least 5 feet of space between each. A portable stalactite can be detected and disarmed as if it were a trap — it’s a DC 20 Perception check to discover, and a DC 15 Disable Device check to safely detach one.",800 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stalactite-portable
Steadfast Gut-Stone,"This fist sized chunk of off-white stone seems too large to fit inside a human's mouth, but may be swallowed with ease as a standard action. Once ingested, the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack, as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0. When a gut-stone is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of damage. Only one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If a gut-stone is not used within a week of being swallowed or is destroyed it crumbles apart and is passed harmlessly out of the body.",800 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/steadfast-gut-stone

Luminous Facet,"This glass cone is welded to a brass base and contains a faint crimson-and-violet fire that burns in the shape of a blooming flower, but sheds no discernible light. By speaking the item's command word, a creature can ignite the flame within a luminous facet, which then sheds light as a torch. Speaking the item's command word again immediately quenches the flame back to its original dimness. A creature need not be holding a luminous facet in order to activate or deactivate it in this way, but it must be within 60 feet of the item. Multiple luminous facets can be crafted to share the same command word, allowing a creature to ignite or extinguish numerous facets within range with a single utterance. The flat base of a luminous facet makes it easy to attach to walls or ceilings using alchemical cement or sovereign glue.",850 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/luminous-facet
Scarecrow Lure,"This life-sized scarecrow is garbed in old clothing and armor. At its center is the real skeleton of a former adventurer. A scarecrow lure is enchanted to writhe and cry out for help as if wounded. The lure's voice is usually that of the adventurer whose remains are inside, though the creator may choose any voice when creating the item. Anyone who hears or sees a scarecrow lure can attempt a DC 11Will save to disbelieve the effect. Activating a scarecrow lure is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.",850 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/scarecrow-lure
Trapped Sword,"This longsword glows and has an aura, making it appear valuable. Its grip is hollow and can be filled with a dose of poison (bought separately, and requiring a full-round action to refill and rearm). Once the sword is grasped, its mechanical trap engages: Small needles in the grip deliver the poison. Detecting the trap requires a successful DC 30 Perception check made by a character with the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC 28 Disable Device check.",850 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trapped-sword
Dust of Dryness,"This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids. If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.",850 ,11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-of-dryness
Bridle of Tricks (3 tricks),"Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated as knowing three additional tricks, as if it had been taught the tricks with the Handle Animal skill. The tricks granted by a bridle of tricks are set when it is created, and cannot be changed. The most common tricks found in a bridle of tricks are attack, defend, fetch, guard, and heel. See Handle Animal for more information on tricks.",900 ,5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bridle-of-tricks
Cap of Light,"This small cloth skullcap resembles those some priests wear, but is topped with a small silver statue in the shape of a lit candle.

Cloak of Human Guise,"This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer's appearance similarly to a hat of disguise, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's non-human physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, human-like eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise.",900 ,1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-human-guise
Elemental Storing Stone,"This small stone appears to be a normal river rock shot through with veins of white marble. At the beginning of each day, an elemental storing stone activates and can begin storing elemental energy. If the wielder of the stone takes 10 or more points of a single type of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the stone becomes charged with that energy. A charged elemental storing stone can be used to launch a single ray attack of the energy type stored within. The ray is a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet that deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. An elemental storing stone may be used once per day. If the stone is charged and not used by the beginning of the next day, the charge is wasted and the stone must be charged again to function.",900 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elemental-storing-stone
Elixir of Forceful Exhalation,"This fizzy, sky-blue liquid leaves its drinker feeling buoyant, yet bloated. The drinker gains a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to make high or long jumps and on Swim checks for up to 1 hour after consuming the elixir. As a standard action, the drinker can exhale a 15-foot-long gust of wind. The drinker can exhale up to three gusts, after which the elixir's effect is discharged and the skill bonuses end.

Murderer's Silence,"In magical societies, speak with dead has captured many a murderer, and so this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. The price listed is for a single dose.",900 ,3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/murderer-s-silence
Saline Purge,"The putrid concoction in this glass bottle smells foul and tastes worse.

Bottled Scream,"Wax and resin seal this smoked glass bottle. When the bottle is opened or shattered, a shrill scream erupts in a 20-foot-radius burst. Any bardic performances with audible components immediately end. Any spellcaster concentrating on or casting a spell must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell. In addition, the scream dispels any silence spells that overlap its area. The bottle can be thrown as a splash weapon or opened by hand. If the bottle is opened, its burst is centered on the opener's space.",900 ,7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottled-scream

"Pouch, Pathfinder","This nondescript belt pouch is quite popular among those who need to smuggle items past snooping guards or government officials. Detect magic does not detect that it is magical (as per the bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic feet). With a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations without their owners realizing their nature.","1,000 ",9,-,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pathfinder-pouch
Bead of Newt Prevention,"This bead is carved with a tiny pictogram representing a small, harmless animal such as a newt, rabbit, or frog.

Beast-Bond Brand,"This sticky henna paste is used to stamp a rust-colored handprint onto the body of a familiar or animal companion, and a hoof, claw, or paw print from that creature onto its master. These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the beast-bond brand for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond brand has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply). A character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time. The brand lasts until all charges are expended or the master marks another companion in this way.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/beast-bond-brand
Boots of the Cat,These high-soled blue boots provide a great deal of comfort and arch support while also making the wearer appear a little bit taller than normal.

Boots of the Soft Step,"These bronze-riveted boots have thick leather soles that compress and expand as you walk. This reduces the force of your footfalls, making you more difficult to detect with tremorsense. If you are walking at half speed, a creature with tremorsense can only sense you at half the usual distance. If you walk at one-quarter speed or slower, a creature with tremorsense cannot detect you at all.","1,000 ",7,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-of-the-soft-step
Burdenstone,"This smooth lodestone is gray and streaked with veins of glossy obsidian. As a ranged touch attack, the bearer can throw it at an opponent within 30 feet. If it strikes a target in metal armor, the burdenstone attaches itself to the target for 2d6 rounds. An attached burdenstone increases the target's load by one step. If a target's load is already heavy, the target is knocked prone, its movement is reduced to 10 feet, and it cannot run. An attached burdenstone also prevents the target from flying. A target may not be affected by more than one burdenstone at a time. A successful DC 20 Strength check made as a full-round action can remove the stone from a target before the duration elapses. Once a burdenstone has been removed or the duration expires, it becomes an ordinary magnetic stone.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/burdenstone
"Chest, Tidy Trunk","This small-sized trunk is bound in polished metal and lined with velvet fabric. While the trunk is latched, items contained within are kept free of mold, moths, water damage, and other undesirable effects of long-term storage, though perishable items still eventually decay. If the trunk is kept latched for at least 8 hours, the items inside are neatly cleaned. The trunk folds and presses clothing, polishes crystalline and metal tableware, removes stains from items, and so on. Items are not repaired of any preexisting damage; they're simply kept clean and organized.","1,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chest-tidy-trunk
"Cloak, Shield","The wearer of this rough, gray cloak can, as a move action, grasp the garment’s edge and cause it to harden. The wearer can use the hardened edge it as if it were a masterwork light wooden shield. Using the cloak in this fashion imposes no armor check penalty, but does impose a 5% arcane spell failure chance. The edge of the cloak can be dropped and made pliant again as a free action. Shield enhancement bonuses and special abilities can be added to the cloak as if it were a masterwork shield.","1,000 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-shield
"Coffer, Death's Head","Typically engraved with numerous skulls, these small metal coffers allow the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging or any damage. In addition, any infectious material—such as the body of a creature that died of disease—is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death’s head coffer can potentially hold several Tiny items, having dimensions of approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches. A death’s head coffer can spread infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a diseaseridden item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature that touches it. For example, a coin placed into a death’s head coffer with a rat infected with the shakes forces any creature that touches the coin to make a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well. After a death’s head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering the box completely mundane. Some death’s head coffers feature complex locking mechanisms, which require DC 20 Disable Device checks to open.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coffer-death-s-head
Concealing Pocket,"This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is sewn onto a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn, it changes its appearance to match the garment. Any magic item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected by magic aura. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment's wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed from the garment with a DC 10 Heal check or an appropriate Craft check such as Craft (cloth) or Craft (leather); failing this roll by 5 or more gives the pocket the broken condition.","1,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/concealing-pocket
Dire Collar,"This leather collar resizes to fit almost any size of creature. Once per day on command, the creature that fastened the dire collar to the animal can cause that animal to grow larger and more bestial. The collar's fastener must be within 30 feet of the animal to do so. The animal gains the benefits of an enlarge person spell (despite the normal targeting restrictions of that spell) for 1 minute.","1,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dire-collar
"Doll, Anatomy","This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child's toy if not for the vital organs depicted on its cloth. By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/doll-anatomy
"Elixir, Bloodbrew","This ruby red wine carries an aroma of fresh-spilled blood with a persistent finish tasting of iron and scarberries. Anyone who drinks the concoction gains 1d10+3 temporary hit points for 1 hour. In addition, an enslaved vampire or vampire spawn who drinks the elixir is freed from its creator’s control for 1 hour, becoming a free-willed undead creature for that time. At the end of the hour, the vampire is once again enslaved under its creator’s control. Bloodbrew elixir is highly addictive to vampires, and any vampire who drinks it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted to the bloodbrew. Thereafter, the vampire must drink a new dose of bloodbrew every day, or take a –2 penalty to Dex, Con, Str, and Wis and lose her fast healing ability, until a new dose is taken. The addiction can only be cured with greater restoration, or the vampire must make three consecutive saves, one per day, against the elixir’s DC, after a day of not taking the drug. Should the vampire take a new dose of the elixir before the addiction is cured, any past successful saves are negated. A living creature who drinks the elixir gains the temporary hit points, but takes a –2 penalty on saves against energy drain and negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy, for 1 hour. Bloodbrew elixir is not addictive to living creatures.","1,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-bloodbrew
Muleback Cords,"These thick leather cords wrap around the wearer’s biceps and shoulders. When worn, they make the wearer’s muscles appear larger than normal. The wearer treats his Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity.

Pendant of the Blood Scarab,"A carved ruby in the shape of a scarab set in gold, this magic amulet grants its wearer insight on where to strike a creature so as to maximize pain and distress. This pendant must be worn against bare flesh in order to function. Once per day, as an immediate action, when the wearer of a pendant of the blood scarab threatens a critical hit with any attack, he may automatically confirm the critical hit. When the user activates this ability, the pendant’s spiky little legs momentarily animate and clutch against the wearer’s skin, dealing 1d6 points of damage as the amulet burrows and digs into the wearer’s body in apparent delight at the devastating blow inflicted on the enemy.","1,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pendant-of-the-blood-scarab
Phylactery of Faithfulness,"This item is a tiny box containing religious scripture. The box is affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead, worn so that the box sits upon the wearer's brow. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to contemplate the act.","1,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/phylactery-of-faithfulness
Plume of Panache,"This plume is over-sized, chic, and extravagant. To gain its effects, the user must affix it to a non-magical hat worth at least 10 gp.

"Powder, Firefoot","This bright red powder contains a mixture of rare herbs and black salt. One dose of fire foot powder is enough powder to spread over two 5-foot squares, usually around doorways. The first creature to enter a powdered square must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or immediately become overwhelmed by waves of fiery pain as if its legs and feet were being burned to ashes. The victim takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for 5 rounds, during which time it is also sickened.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/powder-firefoot
Robe of Needles,"This dark, hooded robe has six long, silvery, razor-sharp needles protruding from the bottom of its loose sleeves, three on each side. The wearer can launch one needle as a ranged touch attack. The needle counts as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the needle hits, it embeds itself in the target’s flesh, dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1 point of bleed damage. A creature can pull out the needle as a full-round action, which ends the bleed effect. The needle is destroyed if an attack with it misses or when it is removed from a creature it was embedded in. The robe regrows all spent needles each morning.","1,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-needles
Shawl of Life-Keeping,"This magical shawl is woven from silken, diaphanous material. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to transfer some of her life energy into the shawl (up to 10 hit points). If she is wearing the shawl and is reduced to –1 hit points or below, the shawl immediately heals her an amount equal to the number of hit points stored in the shawl. This healing cannot prevent the wearer from being killed. The life energy stored in the shawl lasts for 24 hours or until it heals the wearer, whichever comes first. If the shawl is destroyed, the stored life energy is lost. While the shawl is storing a creature's life energy, it retains a connection to that creature. If another creature holds the shawl in hand, the creature whose life energy is stored in the shawl takes a –2 penalty on Fortitude and Reflex saving throws against all effects from the current bearer of the shawl.","1,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/shawl-of-life-keeping

Tengu Drinking Jug,"This looks like a one-gallon stoneware jug with white glaze, black birds painted around the middle, and a cork stopper tied about the neck with a hemp cord. Any liquid placed within the jug becomes safe to drink, as though affected by purify food and drink (though the jug only affects liquids). Three times per day, the bearer can command the jug to alter the temperature of its contents so that it ranges anywhere from ice cold to boiling hot. Once per day, the bearer can command water placed into the jug to transform into plum liquor, sake, or tea.

Bag of Holding (Minor),"This more economical version of the bag of holding functions in the same manner, but its internal measurements are smaller than those of a regular bag of holding.

Pellets and black powder are kept in tiny individual pouches, and bullets in small loops. The bandolier alters itself as needed to accommodate both. There are also places on the beneficial bandolier for a gunsmith’s kit and a powder horn. Regardless of what quantities of these items are placed within the beneficial bandolier, its weight does not change.

"Belt, Meridian","This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a ring of protection, ring of energy resistance, ring of swimming, and ring of counterspells, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires. The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a ring of invisibility is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a ring of sustenance) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.","1,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/meridian-belt
Dimensional Acid (Jagged Pit),"The acid in this flask burns not through matter, but through space itself, creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively, it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid. This acid creates a spiked pit spell where it lands.","1,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dimensional-acid

When then poured onto the ground, the syrup flows at 15 feet per round following the most direct route to the creature or object visualized, provided the creature or object is on the same plane, leaving behind a sticky trail. The syrup can flow uphill or even up stairs and can pass through openings as narrow as one-sixteenth of an inch.

Incense of Transcendence,"The heady vapors of this coiled incense facilitate a deep meditative trance. When an oracle lights a coil of incense of transcendence and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, she can replace one of her revelations with another revelation. The new revelation must be one available to her (such as from the same mystery) and must be available at the same class level as the original revelation (for example, she cannot replace a revelation available at 1st level with a revelation requiring a minimum of 7th level). If she replaces a revelation that is a prerequisite for another revelation or ability, she cannot use that other revelation or ability while under the influence of the incense. The coil of incense burns for 8 hours. Its effects persist for 24 hours, after which the oracle's original revelations return.","1,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/incense-of-transcendence

If the wearer falls unconscious from drowning while wearing a drowning medallion, she can remain unconscious for up to 10 minutes before she must start attempting Constitution checks to avoid asphyxiation. One round after emerging from the substance that caused the wearer to drown (usually water), the wearer regains consciousness at 0 hit points and the medallion crumbles to dust.","1,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/medallion-drowning
Pyxes of Redirected Focus,"This round metal container is just large enough to contain the wooden, coin-sized token inside. Each side of the token is inscribed with a different prayer. Once per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) may activate the pyxes and may select any one of her prepared domain spells and replace it with the domain spell of that level from her other domain. For example, a cleric with the Fire and Luck domains could switch her 1st-level prepared burning hands domain spell to true strike.

Robe of Infinite Twine,"This coarse hempen robe seems made from a single strand of twine. The wearer can draw up to 30 feet of twine or up to 10 feet of hemp rope per round from the robe without harming it. As an immediate action, the wearer can draw up to 150 feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives the robe the broken condition and suppresses its powers until it is repaired. Twine or rope drawn from the robe remains connected until cut or torn, but is treated as common material rather than part of a magic item. Pieces removed become normal twine or rope.","1,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-infinite-twine
Salve of Slipperiness,"This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape from a grapple. The salve also grants a +10 competence bonus to the wearer's Combat Maneuver Defense for the purpose of avoiding grapple attempts. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine). Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container meant to hold sovereign glue.","1,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/salve-of-slipperiness
Solidsmoke Pipeweed,"When smoked in any pipe, this pinch of magical tobacco produces a languid, milky-white smoke that the smoker can transform into useful objects. A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet. A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock. This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickenedfor 1 round.","1,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/solidsmoke-pipeweed
"Stone, Fortifying","On command, this semiprecious stone adheres to an object weighing not more than 100 pounds. As long as it is attached, the stone increases the object’s hardness by 5, its break DC by 5, and its hit points by 20. Like temporary hit points, these additional hit points are lost first when the object the stone is protecting is damaged, and once they are exhausted, the fortifying stone is destroyed. However, unlike temporary hit points, they can be completely restored by repairing the fortifying stone via a single casting of a make whole spell. Any effect that breaks or destroys the protected object also destroys any attached fortifying stones.","1,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-fortifying
Wasp Nest of Swarming,"This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out of paper. It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid case. If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after being released.","1,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wasp-nest-of-swarming

"Gem, Metamagic (Enlarging Amethyst)","Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a full-round action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action).

Clockwork Bug,"This Fine brass construct is made to look like a beetle, and is sometimes painted in green, brown, or gray camouflage. A clockwork bug can record all nearby sounds within a 20-foot-radius spread onto a low-quality gemstone worth 10 gp, which is embedded in its body. The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted. Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action. Once a gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check. Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded sounds on that gemstone. Though a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by up to 24 hours.

The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of grave salt holds 5 doses. Grave salt can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack.

The sponge must be in the affected area of the poison gas in order to absorb it, and once it is absorbed, the duration of the poison effect (if any) is effectively paused. A toxin sponge can absorb either non-magical poisons or magical poisons (and the poisonous effects of magical gases and mists) with a caster level of 9th or lower. A toxin sponge can absorb only one poison at a time; an absorbed poison dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. Alternatively, a creature can squeeze the filled sponge as a standard action before 24 hours have passed to release the noxious gas back into the air centered on the user.

Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.

The hammock refuses to adhere to surfaces not strong enough to support the hammock at full capacity. Once affixed, a caver’s hammock takes on a dark gray, pebbly appearance like that of a typical cavern wall. Anyone attempting to spot the hammock in an underground or naturally rocky setting must make a DC 30 Perception check.

Once applied, the wax imparts a –2 penalty on Perception checks, but imparts a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against charm or language-dependent compulsion effects, like charm monster, command, and suggestion. If placed in the ears of a willing or helpless creature currently under a charm or language-dependent compulsion effect, the dose immediately allows the creature to make a new saving throw against the original effect to throw off the charm or compulsion effect (although without the normal +4 bonus granted by the wax if used when a creature is first targeted by such an effect).

When a goblin skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull bomb. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb. A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as mage hand or telekinesis) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp).","1,200 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goblin-skull-bomb
Traveler's Grandiose Carrying Case,"This masterwork harrow carrying case protects the harrow deck within from harm. When the case is used as part of a harrowing, the light level within 15 feet of the case darkens to dim light and miniature illusions of the interpreted cards appear in front of the harrower and her subjects. While stored in a traveler's grandiose carrying case, a harrow deck gains a +2 bonus on saves against effects that specifically target the deck.","1,200 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/traveler-s-grandiose-carrying-case
Claws of the Ice Bear,"Strapped to the hands, these spiked climbing claws grant a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks made when using both hands to aid in movement, and allow the wearer to ignore the normal penalties on those skills for slippery or icy surfaces. In addition, up to 3 times per day, the wearer can activate the claws as a swift action to gain the benefits of spider climb for 1 round. The wearer cannot hold anything else in her hands while using claws of the ice bear. If used as a weapon, claws of the ice bear function as spiked gauntlets.","1,300 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/claws-of-the-ice-bear
Shawl of Shadowy Disguise,"This violet shawl twists and melds with the darkness, becoming as black as coal in even the faintest shadow. While worn, the wearer can hide her appearance as if with a penumbral disguise spell. Onlookers never discern that the wearer was wearing a shawl of shadowy disguise.","1,350 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/shawl-of-shadowy-disguise
"Boots, Daredevil Softpaws","This pair of magical softpaw boots allows the wearer to gain extra maneuverability while moving through hazardous areas. As a free action, the wearer can click her heels together to grant herself a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through threatened squares or to move through an enemy's space without provoking attacks of opportunity for up to 10 rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive. Furthermore, anytime the wearer of the boots successfully moves though the space of an enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity, she gains a +21 bonus on attack rolls against that enemy until the end of her turn.","1,400 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/daredevil-softpaws
Bag of Rust,"This dull-red cloth pouch is magically sealed and contains fine grains of a powdery substance. As a ranged touch attack, the user can throw the pouch at a creature or object within 30 feet. On a hit, the bag breaks open and showers the target with the powder. If the target is wearing metal armor, the bag of rust rapidly corrodes the armor, lowering its armor bonus by 1d6 (to a minimum bonus of 0). If the target is a ferrous creature or a metal object, the bag deals 3d6+7 points of damage. The user can target a creature's metal weapon with the thrown bag, but the user takes a –10 penalty on such ranged touch attacks, as weapons are more difficult to hit. Metal weapons struck by the bag are destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this effect. If the bag misses its target, use the rules for when splash weapons miss to determine where it lands. If it lands on a metal surface, the bag damages that surface as described above, but it deals no splash damage to adjacent creatures.","1,400 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-rust
Elixir of Dragon Breath,"This gurgling, luminescent elixir comes in several different varieties, each keyed to a particular type of metallic or chromatic dragon. A creature that drinks the elixir can, as a standard action, breathe out a single blast of energy similar to a dragon's breath weapon, dealing 7d6 points of energy damage. Creatures in the area may attempt a DC 16 Reflex save for half damage. The magic of the elixir ends after one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed, whichever comes first. The type of energy produced and the shape of the blast are determined by the elixir's associated dragon type: (Type of Dragon) - (Effect): Black or copper dragon - 30-foot line of acid; Blue or bronze dragon - 30-foot line of electricity; Brass dragon - 30-foot line of fire; Green dragon - 15-foot cone of acid; Gold or red dragon - 15-foot cone of fire; Silver or white dragon - 15-foot cone of cold","1,400 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixer-of-dragon-breath
"Elixir, Deathgag","Death cults such as the Whispering Way use this elixir to prevent their enemies from stealing their members’ secrets, even after death. Elite cultists typically imbibe deathgag elixir as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below –1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim’s entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim’s death, only a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir. Individuals that have imbibed deathgag elixir are noted as being “deathgagged” in the Defensive Abilities section of their stat blocks.","1,400 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-deathgag

Nagaji Scale Polish,"This small clay urn contains a scintillating paste which works like imbue with spell ability, except the spell effect is not limited to cleric spells. Any caster may cast spells into the jar. The creature that applies the paste to its scales (a standard action) gains the ability to cast the imbued spells (assuming it has enough Hit Dice and the requisite ability scores). Only a reptilian creature (such as a dragon or a humanoid with the reptilian subtype such as a nagaji) can use the polish to cast spells.","1,400 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/nagaji-scale-polish

"Talisman, Death’s Head (14 HD)","This amulet allows the wearer to command a number of undead skeletons and zombies, which are keyed to the amulet when it is created. The animation of the undead is part of the creation process—undead that have already been created cannot be bound to a death’s head talisman. The number of HD of undead tied to the amulet is equal to twice the amulet’s caster level. The amulet allows the wearer to command the undead as if she had created them with animate dead, even if she has no magical talent of her own. The undead are only under control while the amulet is worn; if the amulet is removed, the undead revert to normal behavior, standing in place but responding if attacked. Once the specific undead tied to the amulet are destroyed, the talisman loses all power.","1,400 ",7,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-death-s-head
Aegis of Recovery,"An aegis of recovery grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made to recover from a continuing effect, such as ongoing poison damage, daily saving throws against disease, a hold person spell, or lingering damage from an attack. This bonus does not help against initial saving throws against such effects. Should the wearer ever drop below 0 hit points, the aegis heals the wearer for 2d8+3 points of damage and then crumbles to dust.","1,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/aegis-of-recovery
Alchemist's Atlatl,"This wooden atlatl resembles a handheld, lever-controlled catapult. One end sports a shaft covered in carvings of alchemical formulae, and the other is a roughly carved bowl.The user can place an alchemical splash weapon, such as a flask of acid or alchemist's fire, in the bowl. This is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity. When the splash weapon is launched from the atlatl, its range is doubled. Magic items (including an alchemist's bombs) aren't affected by an alchemist's atlatl.","1,500 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/alchemist-s-atlatl
Book of Cults,"This strange leather-bound book contains erratic handwriting; the words within it appear to have been translated from Gnome into Common (and perhaps some other language before Gnome). It contains notations of strange cult practices, disturbing rants about ancient godlike beings, and confusing diagrams resembling summoning circles, with many parts crossed out or obliterated with ink or fire. The bearer of the Book of Cults gains a +1 resistance bonus on Will saving throws while carrying the book. If the bearer's patron is one of the Great Old Ones, the bearer can hold the book in one hand to use it as a lesser extend metamagic rod, but only for conjuration spells that summon or call an evil outsider.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-of-cults
Bookmark of Deception,"This bookmark alters the book that holds it so that it appears to be another book entirely, even upon a thorough reading. The apparent book is determined when the bookmark is crafted, and is usually an especially boring or commonplace book such as a legal or religious text. The bookmark also protects itself and the book with nondetection.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bookmark-of-deception
Boots of the Enduring March,"These travel-stained boots of stout brown leather enable the wearer to traverse great distances without tiring. When making a forced march, for each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, the wearer needs only to make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per extra hour) instead of the normal check. Furthermore, if the wearer fails the check, she only takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage and does not become fatigued the first time she takes nonlethal damage in this way.","1,500 ",2,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-of-the-enduring-march
Brooch of Shielding,"This appears to be a piece of silver or gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, it can absorb magic missiles of the sort generated by the spell or spell-like ability.

Bubble Vault,"This tiny pearl swells to form a 1-foot-diameter soap-like bubble when placed in water. Up to 5 cubic feet of goods can be placed inside the bubble vault. On command, the bubble sinks to the bottom of the water, automatically burying itself 1 foot deep in the bottom ground if there is mud or other loose material present. If the command word is spoken three times within 30 feet of the bubble, it rises to the surface of the water, at which time it can be opened and the items within it retrieved. Once opened, the bubble reverts to its pearl form for 24 hours. The bubble is watertight but does not otherwise magically protect or preserve its contents. If forced open, it has hardness 1 and 5 hit points.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bubble-vault
"Cloak, Quick Change","One side of this reversible gray hooded cape is exquisitely embroidered and richly decorated, while the other appears shabby and worn. On command, by passing the edge of the cloak over her face, the wearer may remove a mundane disguise (one applied with the Disguise skill) and store it in the cloak. This does not change the cloak’s appearance in any way. Once a disguise is stored in the cloak, it can be reapplied to the wearer who placed it within the cloak on command, using the original result of the Disguise check. The cloak can store up to three disguises at once, and any wearer of the cloak can discard any number of disguises within the cloak as a free action.","1,500 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-quick-change
"Coin, Pathfinder's","This apparently simple coin, usually styled to resemble ancient currency, hides intricate gold and platinum wires within. This matrix causes the Pathfinder’s coin to rise an inch into the air and slowly spin in place if placed atop a wayfinder. In addition, when levitating above a wayfinder, the coin can be given a message of 25 words or fewer. This message repeats in the speaker’s voice the next time the coin is floated above a wayfinder. Only one message may be stored at a time, and once it is triggered, the message is expended and a new one may be recorded.","1,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coin-pathfinder-s
Dry Load (Powder Horn),"This weapon special ability can only be applied to alchemical or metal firearm cartridges. Dry load cartridges can be used to load guns underwater or in other airless environments, such as a vacuum. This special ability protects the cartridge's contents as it is being loaded into a firearm and creates a residual bubble of air that surrounds that firearm, further protecting the ammunition and allowing the firearm with this ammunition loaded in it to be fired in an airless environment. After the cartridge is loaded, the bubble of air lasts for 3 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever occurs first. A firearm loaded with this ammunition still takes the —2 penalty on attack rolls when fired underwater for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When firing a dry load cartridge underwater or in an airless environment, a misfire that results in a firearm explosion occurs normally. The listed price is for 50 dry load cartridges.","1,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/dry-load
Flask of Ebon Flame,"This small flask smokes with an odorless black mist when opened. Each flask contains a single use of ebon flame, a strange sort of fire that is hostile to normal fire. Cool to the touch even in hot environs, when poured out, a flask creates a 20-foot-radius burst of black fire centered on the user. This burst of ebon flame extinguishes all natural fires and dispels magical fire (dispel check 1d20+5) in the area, including magic items that have fire effects (such as a flametongue sword or a necklace of fireballs), although items dispelled merely cease to function for 1d4 rounds. The ebon flame can cure damage caused by fire— each creature in the burst is healed 5d6 points of damage caused by fire effects. A creature with the fire subtype inside the area of the burst takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round — a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. Ebon flame is unstable, and when combined in doses larger than a single use, or when not stored in a specially prepared flask, it dissipates harmlessly in a cloud of faint black smoke. Overlapping areas of ebon flame do not stack their effects.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/flask-of-ebon-flame
Handstraps of Roofjumping,These long cloth strips are intricately embroidered with urban scenes.

Kohl of Uncanny Discernment,"The dark cosmetic in this small decorative tube is made from finely ground minerals. Favored by men and women alike, non-magical kohl is applied around the eyes and is used to reduce the glare from the desert sun, and cosmetically to cause the whites of the wearer's eyes to stand out distinctly. When applied to the eyes, kohl of uncanny discernment grants its wearer low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. If the wearer already has low-light vision, the kohl doubles the distance the wearer can see. The wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks, patterns, visual effects, and sight-based attacks. These effects last for 1 hour. Applying the kohl is a full-round action, and it must be applied to both eyes to function. An unopened tube of kohl of uncanny discernment contains 5 applications.","1,500 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/kohl-of-uncanny-discernment
"Mask, Skin","This hideous mask resembles a patchwork, deformed face, with one bulbous eye, a grimacing mouth with long teeth, and a flat nose. When worn, the mask fills the wearer's mind with hideous whispers and images of murder and violence. It heightens the wearer's ability to sense fear. He can smell the cold sweat brought on by terror and hear the thundering beating of a frightened heart. Further, fresh blood glows brightly to him, to the extent that he can see the shimmering traceries of living circulatory systems pumping away in the bodies of those around him. These enhancements grant +2 competence bonuses on Perception checks made against creatures that aren't immune to fear. Further, the ability to plainly see the map of targets' arteries and veins grants the wearer a +1 profane bonus on damage with slashing weapons made against living creatures. Wearing a skin mask leaves hideous mental scars; when the mask is donned, the wearer takes 1 point of Charisma damage as his thoughts become tangled with images of murder.","1,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-skinsaw
Philanderous Compact,"This small, polished leather case opens to reveal a mirror, face powder, rouge, and a puff.

Sporecrafter's Kindness,"This brown hemp sack is filled with mold spores, soil, and chemical reagents. It can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon breaking open, a sack of sporecrafter's kindness releases russet mold spores in a 5-foot-radius burst and unleashes 1d4+1 vegepygmies in the nearest adjacent squares. The vegepygmies are not under the control of the user, and immediately attack the nearest creatures for 5 rounds, after which they collapse into non-magical plant matter.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sporecrafter-s-kindness
"Tattoo, Radiant","This tattoo typically takes the form of a colorful sunburst. The bearer can activate the tattoo with a command word, causing it to flare brilliantly. A single, adjacent foe is blinded for 1d4 rounds. If it succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save, it is dazzled for 1d4 rounds instead. If the target has light blindness, light sensitivity, or is otherwise vulnerable to bright light, it is instead blinded for 2d4 rounds or dazzled for 2d4 rounds on a successful save. If the bearer activates the tattoo while more than one foe is adjacent, she may choose which foe is affected. The tattoo vanishes once it has been activated.","1,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-radiant
"Whistle, Devastating Dog","When blown, this crudely carved reed whistle emits a painful sound that only dogs (or other canine creatures, like wolves, werewolves, or yeth hounds) can hear. All such creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread when a devastating dog whistle is activated must make a DC 11 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d6 points of sonic damage. A creature that fails to resist the effects of this spell is also affected by magical silence, preventing it from speaking or making sounds with its voice (it can still make noise by movement—it just can’t talk or bark or howl) for 1 minute. A devastating dog whistle can be used once per day without peril, but each additional use per day brings a 25% cumulative chance that the devastating dog whistle is destroyed upon activation.","1,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/whistle-devastating-dog-whistle
"Bandolier, Endless","Small loops sewn into this bandolier look like they can hold twenty alchemical cartridges (ammunition for a firearm), but due to a subtle bending of space can actually hold up to 60 cartridges. Additionally, the six thin pockets on the bandolier are extradimensional spaces meant to hold extra guns and gear. The four small pockets can each hold a one-handed firearm, 1 pound of ammunition, a powder horn, or a similarly sized object. The two large pockets are large enough to hold a two-handed firearm or a similarly sized object. The wearer can draw an item stored in the bandolier as easily as if from an ordinary ammunition pouch or holster. The bandolier weighs the same no matter what is placed inside it.","1,500 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bandolier-endless

"Dust, Desiccating","This yellowish gray powder is composed of grave dirt and ground snakeskin. The user spreads the dust in two 5-foot squares, typically across doorways frequented by the intended victims—this takes 1d4 rounds to accomplish. A creature stepping into an area warded by desiccating dust must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid suddenly becoming horrifically thirsty and wracked with pain, taking 5d6 points of nonlethal damage, and immediately becoming fatigued. The nonlethal damage caused by this effect cannot be healed until the creature can drink some water. A creature that remains in an area warded by desiccating dust need not make additional saves to avoid the effect, but if it steps out of the area, it must save again as soon as it reenters the warded area. A creature already taking nonlethal damage or fatigue from desiccating dust suffers no additional ill effect from passing through an area protected by this magical dust. Once a dose of desiccating dust is applied to an area, that area remains warded by the effect for 24 hours, or until a creature is affected by the dust, at which point the entire dusted area expends its magic and becomes harmless.","1,500 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-desiccating
Incense of Dulled Senses,"This gray incense smells of cold granite. When burned, the smoke from the incense spreads to fill a space equal to ten 10-foot cubes. This smoke remains stationary unless moved by wind. If inhaled by a creature with blindsense, scent, or tremorsense, the creature must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If it fails the save, it does not benefit from its blindsense, tremorsense, or scent abilities for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the smoke from the incense dissipates and loses all magical properties.","1,500 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/incense-of-dulled-senses

Word Bottle,"This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle. The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).","1,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/word-bottle
Traveler's Translator,"This single earring consists of a prismatic crystal set into a platinum bezel. A traveler's translator provides its owner a basic and limited ability to communicate with intelligent creatures that speak unfamiliar languages. When created, a traveler's translator is imprinted with a single base language chosen by its creator (typically Common), and is capable of learning one additional language. When its owner speaks the command word, the traveler's translator begins listening to all spoken conversations and speech within 30 feet. After 1 minute of exposure to a language other than its base language, the translator learns the new language. Thereafter, the item automatically translates speech of the newly learned language into the translator's base language, telepathically imparting the translated words to its owner. A traveler's translator can store only one learned language at a time and can learn only one language per day—speaking the command word again after at least 24 hours causes the translator to erase the previously learned language (but not its base language) to make room for a new language. As a standard action, the owner of the stone can designate a single creature within 30 feet. When the owner speaks aloud to that creature in the translator's base language, the traveler's translator telepathically transmits the owner's meaning to the target, using the learned language. A traveler's translator does not grant its owner the ability to read or write in either the base or the learned language.","1,550 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/traveler-s-translator
False Face,"This simple, hand-painted party mask emanates no magical aura. Its true usefulness is revealed only when it's worn.

Bondbreaker's Boots,"These leather boots bear a knife motif worked into their durable blue leather. Three times per day, the wearer can speak a command word as a swift action, causing a serrated knife to fly from the boots and instantly slice through any non-magical bond currently restraining the wearer. The knife conjured from bondbreaker's boots can cut through brambles, ropes, tanglefoot bags, vines, webs, or any other similar non-magical item restraining the wearer, but cannot help when the owner is actively restrained by a creature. Bondbreaker's boots also cannot free the wearer if manacles or chains restrain her.","1,600 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bondbreaker-s-boots
Bridle of Tricks (4 tricks),"Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated as knowing four additional tricks, as if it had been taught the tricks with the Handle Animal skill. The tricks granted by a bridle of tricks are set when it is created, and cannot be changed. The most common tricks found in a bridle of tricks are attack, defend, fetch, guard, and heel. See Handle Animal for more information on tricks.","1,600 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bridle-of-tricks
"Tattoo, Kin's Face","This intricate tattoo covers the bearer's face in thousands of hair-fine lines of ink and carefully incised scars, and even extends to etchings upon the bearer's tusks, together giving the effect of a topographic map of the bearer's face. The bearer can activate the tattoo to cause the marked design to shift and the scars to open and pull the bearer's face into a different shape. The bearer then gains the benefits of disguise self, save that the bearer can take only the form of a specific half-orc, human, or orc, and the disguise lasts up to 5 hours per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. The material components for the kin's face tattoo include rare pigments that are mixed with the bearer's blood, then worked into the bearer's skin. To remove this tattoo, the tattooed portions must be erased and the scars healed.","1,600 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-kin-s-face
Dust of Acid Consumption,"This brown dust is similar to dust of dryness, but affects acid rather than water and absorbs less liquid. If it is thrown into acid, a volume of as much as 10 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble sized pellet floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per gallon absorbed into the pellet (maximum 4d6), affecting all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its point of impact. This is a splash weapon. If the dust is used against an ooze that deals acid damage with its attacks, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the ooze even if its saving throw succeeds.","1,600 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-of-acid-consumption
Elixir of True Form,"This elixir removes all curses and transmutation effects from the imbiber, including the unnatural mutations resulting from the arcane warping of the island of Nal-Kashel or gained through an ancestor’s unspeakable interbreeding with ulat-kini. The elixir stops gillmen from transforming into skum but cannot reverse the transformation if a gillman has already become a skum. Only doses of the elixir manufactured on the island of Nal-Kashel can remove the warping effects of the island’s influence.","1,600 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/elixir-of-true-form

Salve of the Second Chance,"Under tutelage from Embeth Forest sprites, Mother Nightmoss developed this potent salve from the distillation of nightmoss. When smeared on a body or body part from a recently deceased creature, the salve mimics the effects of a reincarnate spell. If this salve is used on a creature during the night of a new moon, roll twice on the reincarnate table and have the recipient player or NPC choose his preferred result.","1,600 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/salve-of-the-second-chance
Necklace of Fireballs (I),"This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Dimensional Acid (Corrosive Pit),"The acid in this flask burns not through matter, but through space itself, creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively, it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid. This acid affects matter as well, creating an acid pit where it lands.","1,750 ",7,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dimensional-acid
"Cloak, Cowardly Crouching","This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer’s entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the sanctuary spell). The wearer cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.","1,800 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-cowardly-crouching
Copycat Siphon,"A copycat siphon is a simple-looking metal tube that can be connected to two flasks, bottles, beakers, or vials of standard size. Three times per day while two containers are connected to a copycat siphon, the user can speak the item's command word while pouring a liquid (including magical liquids like potions or elixirs) into one of the containers. In doing so, the other container attached to the siphon also fills up with an exact replica of the poured liquid, appearing to all normal senses (including touch, smell, taste, and sight) as if it were an exact copy of the original liquid. However, when imbibed, the copy acts only as fresh water, and has none of the other effects of the original liquid. The created liquid registers to detect spells as if it were the original liquid (as the magic aura spell, Will DC 14).","1,800 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/copycat-siphon
Dust of Appearance,"This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. a single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of blur and displacement. In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell. The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. a creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Stealth checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes. Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.","1,800 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-of-appearance
Hat of Disguise (Lesser),"This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a disguise self spell.

"Vest, All Tools","This well-made leather vest bears numerous shiny metal buttons, which stud a number of bulging pockets. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak the vest’s command word and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one Craft skill. These tools appear in the countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes first.","1,800 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-all-tools
Efficient Quiver,"This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape As a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it.","1,800 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/efficient-quiver

"Paint, Tribal War Paint (Black)","There are numerous variations of magical war paint, each providing a specific benefit to aid their hunters, warriors, and heroes in a variety of tasks. Tribal war paint can be applied to any visible part of the body — typically the face, shoulders, legs, or arms. Applying a dose of war paint is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tribal war paint does not take up a magic item slot, but you can only benefit from one color of war paint at a time—applying a dose of a different color replaces the effects of the previous application. Once applied, the effects granted by the war paint last for 24 hours. [ ** Black: You become cloaked in shadows and smoke, gaining the effects of a blur spell.","1,800 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/paint-tribal-war-paint

"Talisman, Death’s Head (18 HD)","This amulet allows the wearer to command a number of undead skeletons and zombies, which are keyed to the amulet when it is created. The animation of the undead is part of the creation process—undead that have already been created cannot be bound to a death’s head talisman. The number of HD of undead tied to the amulet is equal to twice the amulet’s caster level. The amulet allows the wearer to command the undead as if she had created them with animate dead, even if she has no magical talent of her own. The undead are only under control while the amulet is worn; if the amulet is removed, the undead revert to normal behavior, standing in place but responding if attacked. Once the specific undead tied to the amulet are destroyed, the talisman loses all power.","1,800 ",9,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-death-s-head
Warding Lips,"When placed upon the lips, these thin, translucent sheets of wax melt invisibly onto the user's mouth. The user is aware of—but unaffected by—any magical attacks or effects that might harm him through the lips or mouth (such as a succubus's energy drain attack). In addition, the next time he would be exposed to an ingested poison, the warding lips instead absorb the toxin and leave him unharmed. Once exposed to a magical attack or ingested poison, a set of warding lips loses its magic and becomes useless.","1,900 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/warding-lips
Tablet of Languages Lost,"Fashioned from granite, this stone tablet is approximately 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and just over an inch thick. The tablet was once part of a larger stone stele that was publicly displayed for all to see. Now known as the tablet of languages lost, the broken slab is inscribed with a vow of fealty to the emperor in three different languages. The characters and hieroglyphs of the three languages correspond to one another and serve as a translation key between the languages. Once per day, upon speaking the command word, the owner of the tablet can read and understand any written texts as if using comprehend languages for a period of 30 minutes. This does not allow the owner to speak or write unknown languages, or read magical writings (though the tablet reveals that such texts are magical). In addition, if the tablet is readily available and at hand, the owner gains a +3 competence bonus on all Linguistics checks. Finally, if the owner knows at least one of the three languages inscribed on the tablet, he can attempt Linguistics checks to translate the other two languages even if untrained in the Linguistics skill. Possession of the tablet of languages lost serves as an acceptable rationale for the owner to learn one of the three languages inscribed upon it (by putting a rank in Linguistics during character advancement) without the need of a teacher or library. Although the tablet of languages lost was created to ease the transition from pharaonic rule to that of a foreign monarch, other tablets could exist bearing different messages in other languages.","1,980 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tablet-of-languages-lost

Autonomous Cartographer,"Upon command, this item draws your surroundings, out to the limits of your normal vision, rendering them as if depicted by a competent but unexceptional artist. It does not record any details you cannot see. The autonomous cartographer creates the map as needed to fit upon a 1-foot-by-4-foot parchment or scroll contained within the item. A second command erases the scroll, allowing you to use it again.

"Belt, Bladed","Rather than being made of one continuous line of material, this belt consists of many bits of tanned leather joined together by thick metal studs. On command, the belt’s wearer can transform the belt into a single masterwork slashing and/or piercing melee weapon of her choice. As long as she is holding the weapon, she can also revert it back to belt form with a command. Furthermore, the belt can be enchanted like a piercing and slashing melee weapon, using the cost of the belt as the cost of the masterwork item.","2,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-bladed

Blood Reservoir of Physical Prowess,"This blown-glass vial has a chain for attaching it to the handle of a weapon. When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time. The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used. The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn. The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged with the wearer's blood, and cannot be charged by bloodless creatures or those that cannot take Constitution damage.","2,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/blood-reservoir-of-physical-prowess

Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of cat burglar's boots can reroll any one failed Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth check, taking the result of that check in place of the first failed check (even if the second result is worse). In addition, a secret pocket in the boots is built to hold a fully functional set of masterwork thieves' tools. A DC 22 Perception check is required to notice this pocket. Any other object in the pocket causes it to bulge and become obvious to even casual observation.","2,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-cat-burglar-s
Bracers of Steadiness,"These tortoiseshell bracers fit so snuggly against their wearer’s skin that they almost seem part of him. The wearer of these bracers becomes exceptionally calm and composed if she takes her time to accomplish particular tasks. Whenever she takes 20 on a skill check for a skill that primarily depends on her arms and hands, she gains a +5 competence bonus on the check.","2,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracers-of-steadiness
"Cap, Buffering","This cloth hat is floppy and shapeless. It offers its wearer an unusual amount of protection against particularly devastating blows.

"Dust, Restoration","This silky red dust is pleasantly warm to the touch. When sprinkled on a partially decomposed corpse or skeleton, it causes the dead flesh and bones to mend and reform, allowing the corpse to be identified or raised as if it were killed recently (effectively restarting the day count that limits raise dead). If more than half of the bones are missing or the subject has been dead for more than 100 years, the dust has no effect. One vial contains enough restoration dust to restore a single Medium or smaller corpse. Larger corpses can be restored by using multiple vials (two for Large creatures, four for Huge, eight for Gargantuan, and 16 for Colossal).","2,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dust-restoration
Entangling Aiguillette,"This length of prickly green vine is woven into a living aiguillette worn around the shoulder. Once per day as an immediate action when the wearer is struck by a melee attack, she can compel the vine to uncoil and wrap around the attacker, causing the attacker to become entangled (Reflex DC 13 negates). An entangled creature cannot move from its space. At the start of the entangled creature's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw against the entangling aiguillette, though the DC increases by 1 for each round the creature fails its save (to a maximum of 16 after 3 rounds). The entangled creature can also untangle itself as a move action by succeeding at a DC 13 Strength or Escape Artist check. The entangling aiguillette's owner cannot move while entangling a creature, but can release an entangled creature as a free action.","2,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/entangling-aiguillette

This print glows any color the wearer wishes, sheds light as a candle, and is easily visible from a distance of up to 60 feet. Such handprints last for 1 day before fading away.

Goblin Fire Drum (Lesser),"This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the player deal an additional 1 point of fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version). All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer's turn as long as the playing continues. A greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and can create pyrotechnics once per day.","2,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goblin-fire-drum

Horn of Fog,"This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes.

The illusion can be of one of the following: a small hillock of appropriate composition for the terrain, a pile of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it. Hammering the spike into place or removing it is a full-round action.

Lantern of Auras,"A lantern of auras is a bullseye lantern made of cold iron with a series of lenses and colored glass filters that can be flipped down in front of its main aperture. The lantern functions as a bullseye lantern but needs no oil to shed its light. If its command word is spoken, it begins to reveal magic auras as the detect magic spell. It will reveal all auras detect magic reveals over the normal duration of 3 rounds, as long as its light is held on the same area for this duration. Anyone who takes a full-round action to observe the revealed auras during each of these rounds can attempt a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of any magic aura revealed, or a Spellcraft check to identify the properties of a magic item within the area.Roughly 45% of these lanterns have the command word etched on the bottom of the lantern.

Lute of The Battle Ready,"These magic items are usually crafted as lutes, though they can be fashioned as other instruments. On command three times per day, the lute can transform into a +1 spear, +1 longsword, or +1 battleaxe. The type of the weapon the instrument transforms into must be chosen at creation, and the weapon must be appropriately sized for the user of the instrument.

"Mask, Plaguebringer's","Resembling the more common nonmagical doctor’s mask, a plaguebringer’s mask grants a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against nauseating scents and immunity to one specific disease (the disease must be chosen at the time of the mask’s creation—the ones in this adventure grant immunity to blood veil). The mask veils the wearer’s alignment, making him register as neutral to alignment-detecting effects.","2,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-plaguebringer-s
"Slippers, Feather Step","Once per day for 10 minutes, these fine silken slippers allow their wearer to ignore the adverse movement effects of difficult terrain as if subject to the feather step spell, including granting the ability to take 5-foot steps in difficult terrain.","2,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/slippers-feather-step
"Stone, Scavenger's","This jagged, egg-shaped stone emits a faint red glow when not in direct sunlight. By rubbing a scavenger’s stone against a damaged (but not destroyed) construct or object as a full-round action, you repair 1d6 points of damage to the object or construct. If this brings a broken object’s hit points above half its maximum hit points, it loses the broken condition. As a standard action, you can smash a scavenger’s stone against a destroyed object or damaged construct. Doing so immediately repairs the object to full functionality or heals a damaged construct of 10d6 points of damage. Destroyed magic items can be repaired in this manner if their caster level is no higher than 3rd—more powerful destroyed magical items cannot be repaired by a scavenger’s stone. A newly-created scavenger’s stone has 50 charges—smashing a stone against an object uses up 10 charges.","2,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-scavenger-s
"Tattoo, Serpentine","This sinuous tattoo appears to move when the bearer flexes his muscles. Three times per day when the bearer makes a successful melee attack with a monk or performance weapon or an unarmed strike, he can cause the tattoo to lunge like a snake at the creature hit. This allows the bearer to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.","2,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-serpentine
Tome of Dissolution,"This shadowy, waterproof tome is 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. When viewed in dim, normal, or bright light, the tome’s 1,000 ebon pages are blank and any new writing immediately fades from sight, as if erase had been cast upon the page. When viewed in darkness, however, each page becomes outlined with pale, silvery light and anything then written in the tome is recorded in similar, silvery light. Writings within the tome are protected as per nondetection. A tome of dissolution can be used as a formula book or a spellbook; if so, extracts and spells can only be prepared from the tome when viewed in darkness. Necromancy spells, spells of the shadow subschool, and spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor take half as many pages when copied into a tome of dissolution as they would in a normal spellbook or formula book.","2,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tome-of-dissolution
"Wayfinder, Shining","A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a shining wayfinder can be used to cast detect evil—when so used, its needle points not to the north but rather to the nearest source of evil within 60 feet. Once per day, a shining wayfinder can be used to cast protection from evil upon the wayfinder's bearer. A shining wayfinder functions only for a creature that is good-aligned. When held by an evil creature, the shining wayfinder's needle spins in a frantic circle. When held by any creature that is both nonevil and nongood, the needle simply hangs limply, not pointing to anything at all (not even to true north).","2,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-shining
"Aquarium Ball, Replenishing (Standard)","Replenishing aquarium balls act as standard aquarium balls, but are endowed with magical effects beneficial to the creature held within. The power of the magic depends on the kind of replenishing aquarium ball. The ball continually refreshes itself with clean water and fresh food.","2,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/aquarium-ball-replenishing
"Bag, Handy Haversack","A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds. While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does. Editor's Note: Handy Haversack does not indicate the sort of space inside it other than to say it is 'like a bag of holding' which is described as opening to a 'non-dimensional space' whereas the rules on extradimensional spaces explicitly refer to bags of holding and handy haversacks as examples of extradimensional spaces.","2,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-handy-haversack
Clamor Box,"This delicate tin music box can produce a great volume of noise at a specific time determined by its owner. Four command words determine what sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.","2,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/clamor-box
Cockatrice Grit,"This magical grit is used by flinging a dose at a creature within 15 feet by as a ranged touch attack. If the grit hits, the target takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is slowed (as the spell) for 1 round as its body starts slowly turning to stone. Each round that follows, the victim can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the start of its turn as a free action to end the effect; otherwise, it takes an additional 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is slowed for 1 more round. This effect can last for a maximum of 11 rounds. If this Dexterity damage ever meets or exceeds the victim’s actual Dexterity score, the creature becomes petrified permanently, as if by flesh to stone. A dose of cockatrice grit is consumed when it is used, and doesn’t activate until it has been thrown—the grit can be handled safely.","2,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cockatrice-grit
Coldfire Wrappings,"When carefully wrapped around the body of a Medium-sized creature (a process that takes 10 minutes), these magical linen wrappings protect the wearer from fire and provide defense against physical attacks. As an immediate action, the wearer can immolate herself in wispy blue flames that protect the wearer as the chill shield version of fire shield and deal 1d6+10 points of cold damage to attackers. This protection lasts for 10 rounds before the wrappings crumble away into fine ash.","2,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/coldfire-wrappings
"Crux, Chelish","A Devil's crux is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest. When closed, a Devil's crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image — in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box — each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Devil's crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux’s combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet’s four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time — objects that would exceed the crux’s capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Devil's crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant — the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Devil's crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole.","2,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crux-devils
Incense of Eidos,"This incense gives off a musty smell when burned, reminiscent of old tomes in libraries. When a character lights incense of eidos and then spends 10 minutes meditating nearby, she is able to recall with perfect clarity any information she wishes. For the next 10 minutes, the affected character can take 20 on any Knowledge skill check, even if in immediate danger or distracted. One pound of incense of eidos is enough for three 10-minute meditation sessions.","2,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/incense-of-eidos
"Ioun Stone, Emerald Ellipsoid (Cracked)","This stone grants 1 temporary hit point, which is restored automatically at a specific time of day unique to each stone (typically sunrise or sunset). The bonuses from multiple cracked emerald ellipsoids stack (limit 5 temporary hit points).","2,000 ",12,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones/emerald-ellipsoid-ioun-stone
Vest of the Deep,"A vest of the deep creates a constant shell of magical energy that protects the wearer from extreme environmental pressure, such as that inflicted by water at a depth of over 100 feet. It does not provide any protection from constriction or other forms of direct crushing damage, nor does it grant water breathing. Favored by aquatic races who find themselves moving between varying depths in the sea or undertaking visits out of the ocean's depths entirely onto dry land, the vest of the deep is an invaluable tool to the surface-dwelling creature who seeks to explore the ocean depths. These vests are common gifts from aquatic elves to surface-dwelling allies who seek environmental protection when visiting a particularly deep-water settlement. A vest of the deep is typically crafted from the hides of fish and treated to remain supple in and out of water; often, the vests are adorned with complex patterns or other elements to enhance the fashion and sense of style.","2,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-of-the-deep
"Vest, Versatile","This sturdy vest stays dry and spotless in the worst of conditions. You can secure up to six objects (weighing up to 1 pound each) to the vest by holding them to it and speaking a command word.You can retrieve any of these items as a move action. In addition, the vest has four large pockets, each capable of holding as much as 1/2 cubic foot in volume or 5 pounds in weight, and weighing only 1 pound when full.  When closed, the pockets are proof against water and the elements. The first pocket contains 1 day’s worth of trail rations, a quart of water in a waterskin, two candles, and a tindertwig. The vest recreates these items if the first pocket is left empty for 3 days.","2,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-versatile
"Wayfinder, Smuggler's","This time-weathered wayfinder lacks any notable features. Despite its routine appearance, a smuggler's wayfinder has an additional ability generally known only to the person using it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's interior is replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up to 10 pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot of space. This material must be able to fit through the 3-inch diameter opening in the compass's face (such as a thin glass vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper). While the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of the wayfinder cease to function, including any resonant ioun stone powers. While the extradimensional space is hidden, the smuggler's wayfinder emits an aura of faint evocation, as a standard wayfinder.","2,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-smuggler-s
Caller's Feather,"This magnificent feather, plucked from the wing of a powerful erinyes or angel, allows the wearer to call stronger outsiders to her service. The wearer can use the feather to call 2 more HD worth of creatures when casting a planar binding or planar ally spell (including lesser and greater versions) or when casting gate. Alternatively, when casting one of these spells, the spellcaster can expend this feather to summon a single outsider with up to 2 more Hit Dice than the spell would normally allow. For example, he may summon a trumpet archon with planar ally, or a pit fiend with greater planar binding. The wearer gains a +2 insight bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks to influence the creature called. Once used, the feather crumbles to mundane dust.","2,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/caller-s-feather
"Gem, Metamagic (Empowering Topaz)","Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a full-round action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action). The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created—their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding unique gemstone type associated with it.","2,000 ",11,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-metamagic

Runestone of Power (1st),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 1st level.","2,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1
