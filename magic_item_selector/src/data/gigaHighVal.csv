"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Bronze Griffon","When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.","10,000 ",?,?,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/bronze-griffon
"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Ebony Fly","When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.","10,000 ",?,?,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/ebony-fly
"Amulet, Frost Fist","Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid fog. On command, this amulet causes the wearer’s hands to become encased in a layer of freezing iron. The wearer is protected from the frigid cold and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer makes with hands gain the frost weapon special ability and are treated as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The wearer’s hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by cold). The transformation can be ended as a swift action.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-frost-fist
"Banner, Commander's","A commander's banner is a cloth flag or standard (typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long) meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect unless it is mounted properly, and a wielder is carrying the object bearing it. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A character with the tactician class feature carrying a commander's banner can use her tactician ability one additional time per day, she can use it to grant the teamwork feat granted by the tactician ability to allies within 60 feet (rather than 30 feet), and allies can use the granted feat for 2 rounds longer than normal.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-commander-s
"Boots, Caltrop","These knee-high black leather boots have prominent and irregularly shaped heels which seem to bulge from the rest of the shoe. As a swift action, the boots’ wearer can cause the boots to let loose a spray of caltrops through the back of the heels as he moves during the remainder of his round. These caltrops fill each square the wearer moves into during that round. Any creature, including the wearer, occupying or who steps into one of these squares suffers the normal effects of coming into contact with caltrops. Once produced, these caltrops remain in existence until removed from their square, at which point they immediately disappear. The shoes can be used for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-caltrop
"Boots, Tremor","These brown leather boots have a reinforced toe of steel with grooves along the soles, crafted to help the wearer pick up vibrations from the surrounding environment. These boots grant the wearer tremorsense 5 feet as long as he is standing on solid ground.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-tremor
"Clasp, Ancestral","Favored by half-elves seeking to distill their heritage into a combat edge, an ancestral clasp resembles a metal tube, open on both sides and covered in delicate elven calligraphy. Whenever a half-elf fits an ancestral clasp to the pommel, grip, or haft of a longbow, longsword, rapier, or shortbow, the character is treated as though she were proficient with that weapon. In addition, when an ancestral clasp is fitted to any weapon with the word “elven” in the title, the character treats the weapon as if it were a martial weapon, mirroring the Weapon Familiarity elven racial trait. A half-elf who already is proficient with one of the above weapons adorned with an ancestral clasp receives a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls with that weapon. Although this ability stems from the item's magic, the affected weapon is treated as non-magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Affixing and removing an ancestral clasp is a standard action.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/clasp-ancestral
Cloak of the Dusk Walker,"This dark, velvety cloak billows with a dramatic flourish in its wearer’s wake. The cloak grants its wearer low-light vision. In addition, once per day, on command, the wearer can surround herself with darkness, as the darkness spell. While this darkness is active, the cloak also grants the wearer darkvision 60 feet as well as low-light vision.","10,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-the-dusk-walker
"Cloak, Stone (Minor)","This mottled gray cloak looks like granite or some other light gray stone. The wearer can pull a minor stone cloak tight around herself and freeze in place as a move action, which causes the cloak to harden like the stone it resembles. When she does this, the wearer can take no actions other than free actions and is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC but gains DR 5/adamantine. She also gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks while protected in this manner. This effect can be dismissed as a free action.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak
Doomharp,"Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has the bardic performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability. A bard who can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as part of his performance increases the effective radius to 60 feet.","10,000 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/harp-doomharp
Drum of Advance and Retreat,"When played, this sturdy snare drum increases the run speed of allied creatures within 120 feet as if they had the Run feat. Activating the drum is a standard action that requires a DC 20 Perform (percussion) check; maintaining the playing is a free action if the player is running. If the bearer stops playing the drum, the enhanced running speed ends. The drum may be used for up to 1 hour per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 10-minute increments.","10,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/drum-of-advance-and-retreat
Dueling Cuffs,"These tight-fitting mithral bracers grant the wearer a +1 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 if the wearer is wielding one or more weapons that benefit from the Weapon Finesse feat. In a duel, the wielder doesn't take the normal –5 penalty when using the dueling parry action. In addition, the wielder can attempt to deflect ranged attacks from firearms with a dueling parry, but takes a –5 penalty on such attempts.","10,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dueling-cuffs
"Fan, Black Feather","This elaborate fan is made with a dozen black feathers set into a metal handle embossed with a stylized crest. The bearer can use it to create a gust of wind, whispering wind, or wind wall. The fan's effects can be used 3 times per day, in any combination.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/fan-black-feather
Flame of Rage,"This ancient diadem is crafted in the shape of an enraged face with an enormous ruby in the center. The gem allows its wearer to channel her rage into pure flame. While under the effects of rage, as a standard action the wearer can expend 1 round of rage or raging song to cause the ruby to release a beam of fire like a miniature hellfire flume. If the wearer succeeds at a ranged touch attack against a creature or object within 30 feet, the beam deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that target. If the wearer instead expends 3 rounds of rage, bloodrage, or raging song, the beam becomes a 60-foot line instead, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects along that line (Reflex DC 14 negates).","10,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/flame-of-rage
Gloves of Shaping,"These soft leather gloves are constantly encrusted with clay between the fingers and allow the reshaping of otherwise durable materials. The wearer can shape objects with hardness 8 or lower (stone, wood, leather, and so on) as if it were soft clay. While it’s possible to rapidly make crude shapes (shaping roughly 1 cubic foot of material per round), creating fine detail or moving parts requires additional time and an appropriate Craft check, at the GM’s discretion. Materials with more than 8 points of hardness are still affected, though not so dramatically. The wearer may treat these materials as having half as much hardness when attempting to damage or reshape them. For instance, a steel bar normally has 10 points of hardness, but the wearer of the gloves may treat it as having hardness 5, and shape it with woodworking tools. The gloves only affect shaping materials with the wearer’s hands or handheld tools, and only when the wearer desires to do so.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-shaping
"Gloves, Perilous","These black gloves glow slightly during combat. Once per day, if the wearer's unarmed attack threatens a critical hit, the critical confirmation roll gains a +2 bonus. Regardless of whether the critical is confirmed, the attack does an additional 1d8 points of damage.","10,000 ",1,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-perilous
"Harp, Doomharp","Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has the bardic performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability.

Mask of a Thousand Tomes,"The random snippets of script that write across the surface of this parchment-colored eyeless mask hint at the knowledge of the many tomes stored within. The mask grants its wearer a +10 competence bonus on all Knowledge skill checks, but the wearer is blinded while wearing the mask. The mask must be worn for 10 minutes before the wearer gains its bonus.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-of-a-thousand-tomes
Ornament of Healing Light,"This palm-sized holy symbol is composed of tiny pieces of stained glass held in a gold frame. The exact symbol is determined upon the item's creation. As a free action, the creature holding the ornament can project the image of the holy symbol upon any creature or surface within 15 feet, similar to using a shadow puppet and lamp. This light is not bright enough to illuminate an area. If the bearer is a paladin, she may use her lay on hands. Ability on a creature touched by the symbol's light (effectively increasing her lay on hands range from touch to 15 feet).","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/ornament-of-healing-light
Pauldrons of the Bull,"These steel pauldrons are engraved with images of charging bulls. When the wearer makes a bull rush combat maneuver, she can make the check twice and take the better result. Furthermore, they grant a +2 enhancement bonus to CMD against bull rushes.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pauldrons-of-the-bull
Prayer Wheel of Ethical Strength,"Sacred or profane mantras cover the outer face of this cylindrical wooden block, which rotates around a decorative brass spindle. By holding the spindle in one hand while meditating or resting to regain ki, the bearer may attune his ki points to the wheel. Once attuned, the bearer's ki strikes count as good (if the wheel has sacred mantras) or evil (if the wheel has profane mantras) instead of lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points. A creature can only be attuned to one prayer wheel at a time, and a prayer wheel can only be attuned to one person at a time. Only creatures who can make lawfully-aligned ki strikes can use a prayer wheel.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/prayer-wheel-of-ethical-strength
"Slippers, Quick Action","The wearer of a pair of quick action slippers may stand up from prone as a free action. Such movement still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the wearer has the stand up rogue talent, the act of standing up from prone no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/slippers-quick-action
"Stone, Missive","These two small, polished pieces of black rock dangle from simple silver chains and are covered in dozens of tiny arcane symbols etched in red paint. Missive stones are always created in pairs. When you and another person each wear one of the stones, you can send whispered messages to each other as long as you are no more than 3 miles apart.","10,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-missive
"Tattoo, Weapon","This tattoo can store one weapon, sized for the bearer of the tattoo. When no weapon is stored, the tattoo takes the form of an empty sword sheath. When a weapon is stored within the tattoo, it takes the form of the weapon so stored. Storing a weapon in the tattoo is a full-round action, but removing a weapon from the tattoo is only a swift action. This tattoo can only be put on one of the bearer's arms (preventing the other arm from receiving another tattoo), and the weapon automatically appears in the hand of the arm it is tattooed upon. If that hand is not free, the weapon cannot be summoned. If the bearer is tightly constrained in an area too small for the weapon to appear without damaging something, the weapon cannot be summoned. If the tattoo is destroyed while a weapon is in it, the weapon falls to the ground in a random space adjacent to the bearer of the tattoo.","10,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-weapon
Treasurer's Seal,"Six inches in diameter, one side of this porcelain seal shows a many-keyholed padlock, while the other displays a lightning bolt superimposed on an open hand. The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an alarm (mental alarm) and arcane lock on the target item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it casts fire trap on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability). A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal. The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items at any given time. Using it on a fourth item automatically negates the oldest effect.","10,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/treasurer-s-seal

Amulet of the Blooded (Destined),"Each different type of amulet of the blooded grants its wearer powers from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a blood-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers. [  Destined: This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum chain. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws and to AC during surprise rounds or any time he is otherwise unaware of an attack. Once per day, the wearer can reroll one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or caster level check to overcome spell resistance. He must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second result, even if it's lower.  ]","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-the-blooded

If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers. [  Fey: This drop of amber hangs on a silk cord. The wearer can turn invisible for 9 rounds per day (as greater invisibility). The rounds don't need to be consecutive. Three times per day, the wearer can make a melee touch attack to cause a creature to burst out laughing. That creature can take only a move action, but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by this laughter, it is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.  ]","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-the-blooded
Amulet of the Spirits (Flames),"Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. [  Flame: This amulet is a single fire opal hanging from a chain of brass. Twice per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a fire ward. The next time she is struck with a melee weapon, the creature making the attack takes 1d6+4 points of fire damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, twice per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the wearer's turn. Whenever the creature takes fire damage, it takes half again as much damage (+50%). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal.  ]","10,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-the-spirits

If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. [  Stone: This rounded river rock hangs from a copper chain. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of stone, granting herself DR 5/adamantine against the next two melee attacks against her. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not expended. In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic; this effect lasts for 2 rounds. Whenever the creature is attacked by a melee or ranged weapon made primarily of metal, it takes a –4 penalty to AC.  ]","10,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-the-spirits
Amulet of the Spirits (Waves),"Each different type of amulet of the spirit grants its wearer powers from one type of shaman spirit bond, but makes her vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with that spirit bond (such as a spirit-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated mystery or spirit wears the amulet, that wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of her mystery or spirit powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of mystery or spirit powers. [  Waves: This amulet is a small conch hanging from a cord of woven seaweed. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can activate a ward of mist, granting herself concealment as the blur spell. The mist dissipates after it causes two attacks to miss because of concealment or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. In addition, as a swift action once per day the wearer can cause one creature within 30 feet to become more susceptible to the sapping powers of cold for 1 minute. When a creature takes cold damage while under this effect, it is entangled for 1 round. If the creature takes cold damage while already entangled by this effect, the duration of the entangled condition increases by 1 round.  ]","10,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-the-spirits
Bag of Concealment (II),"A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size (it can hold 500 lbs in 70 cubic ft), except for a few key points. Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only be keyed to one person at a time)—should the bag’s owner be killed, it becomes keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag’s outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag’s magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as non-magical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger goods may be hidden inside.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-concealment
Bag of Holding (IV),"This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. It can hold 1500 lbs. in 250 cubic ft.. If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. ** Editor's Note: Bag of Holding refers to the space inside as 'non-dimensional' whereas the rules on extradimensional spaces explicitly refer to bags of holding as examples of extradimensional spaces. **","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding
"Baldric, Bane","This ornate sash of embroidered velvet stretches across the chest from shoulder to waist. If the wearer is an inquisitor, she is treated as five levels higher when using her bane and greater bane abilities . If the wearer is not an inquisitor, she gains the bane ability of a 5th-level inquisitor, but must first attune a light or one-handed melee weapon to the baldric by hanging it from the cloth for 24 hours, and can only use the bane ability with the attuned weapon. Attuning a new weapon to the baldric ends the attunement for the previous weapon.","10,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/baldric-bane
"Banner, Lord's (Swiftness)","A lord's banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Swiftness: A group or army that are traveling under a lord's banner of swiftness can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.","10,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-lord-s
Belt of the Weasel,"This surprisingly soft belt has an absurdly large buckle, made even more absurd by the fact that it’s crafted in the shape of a smiling weasel’s face. It grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and the ability to move at half normal speed while prone. Treat the enhancement bonus to Dexterity as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not take a penalty on melee attack rolls or to AC against melee attacks while prone.

Belt of Thunderous Charging,"An engraving of a charging rhinoceros decorates this thick leather belt. The belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The belt magnifies the wearer’s momentum whenever she charges, granting her a +2 bonus on bull rush and overrun maneuvers. Furthermore, when the wearer makes a charge attack, her melee weapons and natural weapons deal damage as if they were one size category larger than they actually are.","10,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-of-thunderous-charging
"Boots, Bogstrider","These soft leather boots smell strongly of marsh gas, and leave faint wet prints behind even when they're dry. Despite these aesthetic flaws, bogstrider boots are of great use in areas of swampy terrain. They provide the wearer the ability to move without penalty in squares of shallow or deep bog, and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted by the boots' wearer are unchanged in squares of shallow bog. In addition, three times per day when the wearer takes a charge or withdraw action, she can increase her speed by 60 feet for 1 round.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-bogstrider
Boundary Chalk,"The surface of this stick of white chalk is covered with silvery runes. Drawing a line with the chalk creates a wall of force that is as long as the line and extends 10 feet perpendicular to the surface on which the line was drawn. Drawing a 5-foot line is a standard action that provokes acts of opportunity. Each wall lasts 10 minutes; the bearer of the chalk can dismiss a section of wall as a swift action by touching the stick of chalk to it.

Chime of Resounding SIlence,"This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if it were the target of a silence spell. This ability can be used once per day. The chime vibrates silently for the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time passes. On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative 20% chance that the chime prematurely ends the magical silence and releases the pent-up sound as a shout spell as a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its silence early and unleashing the shout in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the shout effect in a random direction. A broken chime of resounding silence cannot be used until it is repaired. The chime has no effect if struck in an area of silence it did not create.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chime-of-resounding-silence
"Cloak, Cocoon","This ruffled silk cloak is incredibly durable despite its soft, delicate construction. Anytime the wearer falls asleep (whether the sleep is natural or brought on by a magical effect), the cloak immediately transforms into sticky strands that envelop the wearer’s body, hardening into a solid silk cocoon. While wrapped in the cocoon the wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and is protected from critical hits and sneak attacks as if subject to the light fortification armor ability (25% chance for normal damage on a critical hit). The cocoon opens and transforms back into a cloak once the wearer awakens.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-cocoon
Collar of the True Companion,"Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience. If worn by a creature of the animal type with an Intelligence less than 3, a collar of the true companion grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the item’s creator). If the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the awaken spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties. If a collar of the true companion is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal type, the wearer is feebleminded until the collar is removed.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/collar-of-the-true-companion
Construct Channel Brick,"This solid red brick changes its shape to match its bearer's holy symbol. If the bearer has the channel energy class feature, she can focus her power on the brick, allowing her to repair damaged constructs and objects as if they were living creatures. The item works whether the bearer channels positive or negative energy. If the bearer has the artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of damage to her channel energy result when repairing constructs and objects.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/construct-channel-brick
Earth Child Faceguard,"An earth child faceguard is designed to refine the wearer's focus when fighting giants. The wearer gains the benefits of Earth Child Style, regardless of whether she meets the prerequisites. If the wearer does not possess the defensive training racial trait, the dodge bonus to AC against giants is reduced to +2. If the wearer already possesses the Earth Child Style feat, she can enter the earth child stance as a free action.","10,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/earth-child-faceguard
Eldritch Egress,"This cunningly designed bundle of wooden slats unfolds and interlocks to form a 3-foot-by-3-foot frame. Once per day you may place the unfolded frame upon a solid surface to form a passage up to 10 feet deep, as if using a passwall spell. The passageway lasts for 1 hour unless the frame is removed earlier. Folding or unfolding the frame is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Using the unfolded frame to create a passage is a standard action. Medium or smaller creatures can easily pass through the tunnel, while Large creatures require an Escape Artist check. The eldritch egress can only be removed from outside the surface it was placed on, so careful planning is required when using it.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/eldritch-egress
Embalming Thread,"This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of embalming thread contains 20 lengths. If the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/embalming-thread
Eye of the Void,"The eye of the void normally appears to be a small black glass or crystal ball 3 to 4 inches in diameter. However, when commanded to open, the eye reveals itself as the terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from the dark spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer may hold the eye and speak one of two command words to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect in a 30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15-foot sphere. Each creature subject to the gaze must make a DC 16 Will save; success means the creature is shaken for 1 minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/eye-of-the-void
Hexing Runes,"These runes may be carved from wood or cast in silver and are worn on a leather cord. When a witch prepares her spells, she may also choose to use the hexing runes to augment one hex she can use. The save DC of this hex increases by 1 for 24 hours. Additionally, once per day when she speaks the command word, the wearer gains the benefits of the ward hex as if cast by an 8th level witch.","10,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hexing-runes
Hourglass of Last Chances,"This tiny hourglass is filled with blood-red sand. The sand flows only one way and turning it to start the flow activates its magic. It grants a target creature within 30 feet the following benefits for a limited time—freedom of movement (as the spell), and suspends any and all of the following conditions: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. These effects are suspended rather than dispelled; they resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended and this suspended time does not count toward the duration of the suppressed effect. Ending the hourglass's effects is a swift action. The hourglass can be used for up to 5 rounds in total before its magic is consumed. These rounds need not be consecutive.","10,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hourglass-of-last-chances
Hunter's Tree Fort,"This item appears to be a wooden puzzle box approximately 3 inches on a side. When the box is placed on the ground beneath the boughs of a tree with a trunk at least 2 feet in diameter and the command word is spoken, the box unfolds and rises, melding with the tree. It becomes a stable structure attached to the limbs 20 feet above ground level, with a rope ladder hanging down from a trapdoor on the underside of the platform. The outer surfaces of the tree fort take on the visual characteristics of the tree in which it is erected, and require a DC 25 Perception check to notice (DC 15 in a dead tree or tree that has shed its leaves). There are two forms the tree fort can take, chosen at the time the device is activated. [  ** Tree House: This version of the tree fort unfolds into a 20-foot-square, open-air platform with railings on all four sides but no roof. It is open to the elements and provides no protection from the weather, but it has enough convenient braces and knotholes to allow tents to be erected across its surface. Creatures standing in the tree house gain the benefits of partial cover against opponents on the ground, while those who are prone within it have total cover; ** Blind: This version of the tree fort forms into a 5-foot-square hunting blind. It is enclosed on all sides, has a roof, and is equipped with a number of narrow horizontal windows for watching or shooting from any side. Creatures inside the blind have improved cover against all foes outside.  ] In either form, a hunter's tree fort remains open for up to 12 hours in any 24-hour period; these hours of use don't need to be consecutive. If the duration expires while the tree fort is occupied or the tree fort takes 50 points of damage (hardness 5), the fort descends and folds itself back up into its puzzle box form, leaving all inhabitants unharmed on the ground at the base of the tree. If the tree fort was forced to return to box form due to damage, it can't be activated again for 24 hours.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hunter-s-tree-fort
Interpretation of Secrets,"This seal is a disk of mithral inscribed with dozens of spiraling arcane and magical sigils. As long as the seal is carried visibly, the carrier can speak and understand all of the elemental tongues. Furthermore, he gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks made against genies, as long as he speaks in the genie’s native tongue. Language-dependent spells cast by the carrier of interpretation of secrets are enhanced — any genie that is targeted by such a spell suffers a –2 penalty on any saving throw to resist the effect of the spell.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/interpretation-of-secrets

"Ioun Stone, Emerald Ellipsoid (Flawed)","This stone grants the wearer 5 temporary hit points (stacking to 25 for multiple emerald ellipsoids of any kind), which are restored automatically at a specific time of day unique to each stone (typically sunrise or sunset). Each stone inflicts one negative level upon you no known limit); these negative levels remain as long as the stone is in use, and disappear when it is no longer in use. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the stone is used.","10,000 ",12,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones/emerald-ellipsoid-ioun-stone

Ki Mat,"This humble pad of woven river reeds allows its owner to recover his mental fortitude and ki pool by practicing breathing exercises and other forms of meditation. Each hour its owner spends sitting on the mat without taking any other action, he can attempt to center himself by making a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 plus the monk's current number of ki points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a 20).

Malleable Symbol,"This undistinguished metal lump has no powers in its default state. By concentrating on it for 1 minute, a creature who worships a deity may transform it into a masterwork holy symbol of that deity. Whenever this holy symbol is used as a focus for channeled energy, as a free action the bearer can alter the channel area to one of the following options: [ ** 10-foot burst centered anywhere within 30 feet ** 60-foot line ** 30-foot cone  ] The symbol reverts to its nondescript lump form after being away from its bearer for 24 hours.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/malleable-symbol
"Mask, Medusa","This intricate mask is made of gold-plated iron. Writhing snake tails radiate from a gemstone upon the brow, almost as if they were medusa-like hair. The mask grants a +4 bonus on all saving throws against visual effects, including gaze attacks and sight-based illusions. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cause the central gemstone to glow with pale green light, at which point she may target any one creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be petrified for 1 minute, as if by flesh to stone.","10,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-medusa
Migrus Locker,"This small locker is carved from fossilized wood and it is usually found chained and sealed. When the locker is unsealed and opened, the migrus—a desiccated hairless cat with a humanoid face—is found within. After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the migrus locker. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master. The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body. The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar except it has the construct type. The migrus always does its best to return to its master and cannot be permanently destroyed by normal means. If the locker is destroyed (hardness 5, 10 hp), the migrus is destroyed, no matter the distance to the locker.","10,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/migru
"Satchel, Book Thief's","Often used by spies and arcane scholars to steal important texts without alerting their owners, a book thief's satchel contains enough room to hold a single tome of no more than 1,000 pages and no larger than 12 by 18 inches in size. Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents, and the text being copied is lost forever. A book thief's satchel can't transfer magical writing (such as the pages of a wizard's spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous item). Attempts to do so fail immediately, neither erasing the book to be copied nor copying any of the pages to the blank book.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/satchel-book-thief-s

Spirit Planchette (Cold Iron),"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist—brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface—it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette’s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board—at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the séance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below.  The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day—the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a –2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient—the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically “maybe.” If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie. [  (Questions per Use) - (Will save DC) - (Confusion Duration) - (True Answer) - (Lie): 3 - 15 - 2 round - 01–75 - 76-100  ]","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spirit-planchette
Summon-Slave Crystal,"This thumb-sized crystalline skull is carved with necromantic runes. Once per day, a spellcaster can grasp the stone while casting a summoning spell. When the spellcasting is finished, the caster may immediately attempt to possess the summoned creature, as if using magic jar, except as a free action. The creature does not get a saving throw to resist, though spell resistance still applies. If successful, the caster possesses the creatures' body until the duration of the summoning spell ends, at which time his mind returns to his body, the creature's mind returns to its body, and the creature disappears.","10,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/summon-slave-crystal
"Tattoo, Reservoir","Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can transfer into the tattoo an ongoing single-target spell (of up to 3rd level). The spell must be one the bearer cast on itself. While stored in the tattoo, the spell’s effects are suppressed, and the spell’s duration is similarly suspended. As a standard action, the bearer can bring the spell back into effect on itself. Spells stored in reservoir tattoos are lost when the bearer next prepares spells.","10,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-reservoir
"Gloves, Pliant","Wearing these form-fitting finger-less black gloves makes the wearer’s arms and body more flexible. As a swift action, the wearer can lengthen his arms for up to 10 rounds per day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended arms is unwieldy, and the wearer takes a —2 penalty on attack rolls, increasing to —4 if he is using two-handed weapons. Even when his limbs aren't extended, the wearer gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks and Acrobatics checks to avoid falling damage. The wearer is still able to use hand-based natural attack such as claws while wearing the gloves.","10,000 ",9,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-pliant

Orb of Consumption,"This cruel device could not seem less intimidating—it appears as nothing more frightening than a hollow sphere of pink glass the size of a halfling's head. When it is held in both hands and its command word is spoken, a pulsing light throbs at the core of the sphere and the sound of an ongoing exhalation of breath emanates from the orb. This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates, up to a maximum of 6 rounds per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb that possess an Intelligence of 3 or higher (save the orb's user, who is immune to its effects as long as it is held) must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to approach the sphere and touch it—this save is required every round the creature remains within 10 feet of the user and the orb. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The first applicable creature to touch an active orb of consumption takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (a successful DC 15 Will save negates this damage). The life energy and sanity consumed by the orb grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 hour per point of Constitution or Wisdom damage dealt. Additional uses do not increase the bonus to Charisma but do increase the duration of the effect.","10,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-consumption
Stone Horse (Courser),"This item is a roughly-hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind. A stone horse is combat-trained. A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem) or by casting stone to flesh, then using healing spells until it reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically returns to its stone form. ** (Courser) - This item has the statistics of a horse with hardness 10.","10,000 ",14,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-horse
Glove of Storing,"This device is a single leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If the glove’s effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly. A glove of storing uses up the wearer’s entire hands slot. The wearer may not use another item (even another glove of storing) that also uses the hands slot.","10,000 ",,,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/glove-of-storing
Boots of the Mastodon,"These massive boots are made from mastodon hide. The boots are so large and cumbersome that their wearer takes a —2 penalty on Stealth checks, but gains a +2 enhancement bonus on overrun attempts and a +2 dodge bonus to AC while attempting an overrun combat maneuver. In addition, once per day the wearer can make a trample attack. Regardless of his actual size, the creature wearing the boots can trample creatures of size Large or smaller in his path.

Canopic Wrap,"Tattered and yellowed, this belt is made up of dozens of interwoven linen wraps bound together by a simple stone buckle at the front. Crafted from mummifies' wrappings, these belts are commonly used by explorers. While worn, the belt grants a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot. A canopic wrap also causes strange internal shifts in key organs, moving them randomly within the body. Because of this odd effect, the wearer gains the benefits of the light fortification armor special ability. This effect also plays havoc on trained healers, however, increasing the DC of any Heal check used on the wearer by 5.","10,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/canopic-wrap
Shoes of Lightning Leaping,"These short black shoes fit tightly around the wearer’s feet and bear designs of leaping arcs of lightning and wild winds. Once per day on command, a creature wearing these boots can transform into lightning and move up to 50 feet in a straight line, re-materializing at the far end of the lightning bolt. Creatures in the path of the lightning take 6d6 points of electricity damage and objects take damage as per the lightning bolt spell.

Summoner Slayer Eyes,"These golden-white lenses rest in crystal frames that fit comfortably over the eyes. Any creatures conjured by summon monster or a similar spell in the wearer's field of vision appear to the wearer as though they were surrounded by a shimmering, purple glow. The wearer sees non-native creatures that have been called by other forms of magic (such as planar ally or gate) outlined in a blue glow. This affects only creatures of which the wearer is already aware. It doesn't bypass concealment or stealth, nor does it work if the target is under the effect of an illusion spell that the wearer hasn't seen through. Once per day when the wearer hits a summoned or called creature with a weapon, the wearer can concentrate on that target, attempting to banish it back to its place of origin. This is treated as a dismissal spell targeting the creature, which must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be sent back to its home plane.","11,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/summoner-slayer-eyes

Fate-Reader's Lenses,"Fate-reader's lenses consist of two specially crafted harrow decks. The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card—one deck's eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding blue-eyed card, as if using enter image. The owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and selecting a specific card is a full-round action. If the corresponding blue card is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again by either you or another creature. Only a single pair of cards can have a visual link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes. If a blue card or a red card is destroyed, the matching card of the opposite deck loses its magic.","11,250 ",5,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/fate-reader-s-lenses

The wearer must concentrate as normal to learn all possible information about the object or creature in question. nce per day as a standard action, the wearer can sniff the air for signs of danger while considering a specific course of action to gain an effect similar to augury.

Amulet of Euphoric Healing,"While worn, the magical liquid within the amulet tinges the user's healing magic with a wash of ecstasy that acts as a magical drug, making the recipient of the healing more susceptible to mental manipulation by the wearer of the amulet. Anytime the wearer casts a healing spell or uses a spell-like ability on a single target, the recipient of the magical healing additionally must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become addicted to the wearer's healing spells.

These plants count as difficult terrain and grant cover to any Medium or smaller creature within the square. They also provide enough food to sustain two Medium creatures for 1 full day. While the plants can grow on surfaces that would not normally support vegetation such as a wooden floor or cave stone, they cannot sprout on surfaces explicitly hostile to vegetation.

When worn, the veiled eye has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60 ft., or the oracle’s clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However, should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the veiled eye instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source, he takes a —2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.","12,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/eye-veiled

Lantern of Concealment,"This black lamp has a wooden frame wrapped with a cover made from white linen, on which are drawn numerous spidery runes and constellations. While lit, a lantern of concealment creates a hide campsite effect in a 20-foot cube centered on the lantern that lasts for 10 hours. This effect moves with the lantern, but only functions while the lantern is stationary.

Lenses of Figment Piercing,"When the wearer first sees an illusion effect with the figment subschool with a visual element, and that figment allows a saving throw, she can immediately make any allowed saving throw to realize the image is illusory instead of waiting to interact with it. This has no effect on illusions of other subschools or on illusions that do not normally allow a saving throw. If the wearer fails to disbelieve the illusion and later interacts with it in such a way as to qualify normally for a saving throw to disbelieve, she gains a +4 competence bonus on this saving throw.","12,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lenses-of-figment-piercing

Radiant Panel,"This small glass cube bears shallow indents carved into each side. Pressing an indentation as a standard action creates a thin sheet of hard light that is 5 feet wide. The sheet covers one edge of a 5-foot square, chosen at activation. While active, the sheet blocks attacks as if it is a solid wall, granting total cover against attacks and spells that pass through this edge. The sheet has hardness 10 and 30 hp. Force effects bypass this sheet, acting normally. The edge chosen can even be a horizontal one, creating a platform that can hold 500 pounds of weight. Once active, the cube anchors itself in place, preventing the sheet from moving. Moving the cube while it is active requires a successful DC 22 Strength check. If the cube moves or if more than 500 pounds of weight is added to the sheet, the sheet shatters, requiring another activation to create a new sheet. Light sheets created by the cube remain for 1 minute and a cube can create up to 5 sheets per day.

Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury,"This small statuette — carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone — is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears of a fallen orc’s blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around the neck. The figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the Diehard feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the Diehard feat, he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit points. Whenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points, the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams and shatters.","12,000 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-of-the-orc-mother-s-fury

In the hands of a casual wielder, these items simply appear to be magically enhanced masterwork tools for a specific Craft skill (determined randomly), granting a +4 circumstance bonuson such skill checks. However, in the hands of a craftsman with 6 or more ranks in the selected Craft skill, the greater power of the amazing tools of manufacture becomes apparent. The wielder may use the tools to create items using the Craft skill much more surely and quickly. The wielder may take raw materials with a value equal to half the price of an object to be crafted, and produce a finished object in as little as 1 hour for an item with a final cost of 2,000 gp or less. For objects with a final cost of more than 2,000 gp, the wielder can perform 2,000 gp worth of work in a single hour, but only once each day.

"Tunic, Shadowbond","This black linen tunic has simple brass buttons. Once per day, the wielder can attune the garment to one ally by standing for 1 minute in a position in which both the wielder’s and his ally’s shadows overlap. For the next 24 hours, whenever the wielder is adjacent to that ally and that ally takes damage, the wielder can sacrifice up to 10 hit points to prevent an equal amount of damage done to the ally. This damage cannot be reduced or redirected, and if the wielder is incapable of sacrificing hit points, the damage to the ally cannot be prevented. If the vest is removed before its duration ends, the connection between the wielder and ally is lost and the vest is powerless until 24 hours have passed since its last attunement.","12,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tunic-shadowbond
Amulet of Channeled Life,"This amulet consists of a pale translucent gem in a dull gray metal setting etched with ancient runes. When worn by an individual with the negative energy affinity racial trait, it alters the effects of positive energy on his body. When targeted by positive energy that heals living creatures, the wearer instead gains half the hit points the positive energy heals as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points go away after 10 minutes. This effect does not stack with life channel or other effects that convert healing positive energy to temporary hit points. This item does not actually transpose positive energy into negative energy, it just affects the way the wearer's body reacts to positive energy.

Black Soul Shard,"This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death. Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again.

The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light.

The master of four quarters is made of ivory and set with red and blue jewels at the corners. Once per day, a character who takes a standard action to present the seal and the bottle it graces can use a charm monster spell against a single elemental creature in range of the spell.

This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion effect. The bearer is immune to the sound of the pipes. When the bearer stops playing, for the next 2d4 rounds all creatures who were fascinated by the music are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise.

This spell must be able to target the bearer in its animal form. The bearer does not need to be able to cast the spell contained within a spell totem in order to use this item.

When the wearer is struck in melee, she can trigger the glyph as an immediate action, causing the glyph to discharge against the creature making the attack (and other creatures within 5 feet, if a blast glyph was placed, though the wearer is not harmed by the glyph‘s effects).

A humanoid with two necrograft arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. Each necrograft arm also provides its host with a natural slam attack (replacing any natural attacks that limb may have once had) that deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage (1d3 for Small creatures) as a secondary attack. If a host attacks with only slam attacks in a round, the slams are instead considered primary attacks.

At the start of each day, the owner of a mantle of the protector may spend 10 minutes attuning the mantle to his armor and shield. He may then lend his attuned mantle to an ally, who can activate it as an immediate action at any time to gain the owner's armor and shield bonus as well as any other special properties the armor may have for 10 minutes.

It has three settings: 0–30 feet, 30–60 feet, and 60–90 feet. In addition, setting the range on a greater assassin's sight is a standard action (though it still provokes attacks of opportunity).

Grasp of Granite,"This left-handed black iron gauntlet appears little more than a dull soot-stained plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is a powerful boon granted by a god to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your left hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then slowly transforms to supernaturally hard black stone. You cannot use your left hand for anything beyond smashing it into objects or creatures (you cannot carry a shield or secondary weapon and you take a –4 on skill checks that usually require two hands). The gauntlet cannot be removed without a successful casting of remove curse, break enchantment, or a similar spell. The gauntlet grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and acts as a +1 adamantine gauntlet. The item also grants you the ability to use the gauntlet as a secondary natural attack.

The wearer also gets a +5 bonus to CMD against the steal maneuver. Once per day on command, the wearer can touch a single item of up to 10 cubic feet and shrink it into a tiny cloth duplicate as the shrink item spell. With a move action, the wearer can draw one of these items from one of the belt’s pockets and return it to normal size.

"Tattoo, Swirling Smoke","This simple tattoo emits a constant haze of odorless, shadowy smoke around the limbs of its bearer that she can animate with a thought, hiding herself behind a screen of smoke. If the tattoo is visible when the bearer is hit by a melee or ranged attack or when the bearer fails a Reflex save, the wearer can activate the tattoo to shroud herself in mist as an immediate action. This imposes a 20% miss chance on attacks made against the bearer. On a failed Reflex save, it grants the ability to reroll the Reflex save and gain a +4 bonus.

Waters of Transfiguration,"This small lacquered box made from exotic and colorful woods contains five vials and a single dropper. The vials are labeled 'glass,' 'iron,' 'paper,' 'stone,' and 'wood,' and each contains a magical fluid that permanently transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked 'paper' on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid.

Clasp of the Mind Scream,"This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with others, yet proves difficult to control. It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.","12,800 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/clasp-of-the-mind-scream
"Amulet, Forge Fist","This fist-shaped stone amulet glows with a fiery light. On command, this amulet causes the wearer’s fists to transform into red-hot flaming adamantine. The wearer is protected from the searing heat and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain the flaming weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer’s hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire). The transformation can be ended as a swift action.","13,000 ",6,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-forge-fist
"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Tin Imp","These fat, smirking imp figurines are made of solid tin. A tin imp turns into an imp on command, though it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it a +4 armor bonus to AC. In imp form, a tin imp can turn invisible at will as a swift action, though it retains none of an imp's other spell-like abilities and lacks a poisoned sting. Tin imps generally avoid combat, but make excellent spies and trackers. The tin imp's owner can, as a move action, designate a single creature in his line of sight as the tin imp's quarry. The tin imp then follows its quarry clandestinely, and sends a whispered message to its owner once each hour detailing the quarry's location and activities. The message is similar to the whispering wind spell, though the message unerringly locates the tin imp's owner instead of moving to a predetermined location. A tin imp can maintain its animate status for up to 48 hours per week. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-hour increments. If slain in combat, a tin imp is destroyed. Additionally, a creature with the track class feature can command a tin imp he owns to study a set of footprints (a standard action) and designate the creature that made the footprints as its quarry. The tin imp can then attempt to track the creature as if its owner was tracking it, using the owner's Perception and Survival skill (and any tracking bonuses).","13,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/tin-imp-figurine-of-wondrous-power
Gem of Brightness,"This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts. [  ** One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination. ** Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge. ** The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.  ] A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.","13,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gem-of-brightness
Harp of Contagion,"This grand-looking wooden harp is carved with images of various venomous creatures. Once per day the bearer may play the harp to target a single opponent with a poison spell (DC 16). Alternatively, the bearer may play the harp to grant allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease and poison; maintaining this benefit each round is a standard action. If the player has the countersong bardic performance ability, he may expend rounds of bardic performance to use the harp to refocus his countersong against disease and poison instead of sonic or language-dependent effects.","13,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/harp-of-contagion
"Kilt, War-Kilt of the Dervish","A favored item among the dawn dervishes, this skirt of overlapping, brightly colored silk is magically reinforced, granting you increased durability and mobility. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC and a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics and Perform (dance) checks. Once per day, when an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to that foe. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.","13,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/kilt-war-kilt-of-the-dervish
Lyre of Building,"This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes. The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.","13,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lyre-of-building
"Robe, Monk's","When worn, this simple brown robe confers great ability in unarmed combat. If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-Level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.","13,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-monk-s
Gauntlets of the Unchained,"Said to have first been forged centuries ago by a human master blacksmith who escaped from drow slavers, these shimmering silver gauntlets remind the wearer that she is always shackled to the deeds of her past, but remains unfettered with the promise of a freer future. The wearer of a pair of gauntlets of the unchained may only wield weapons two-handed—the magical chain that binds the gauntlets makes it effectively impossible to wield or hold more than one item at a time. By tapping the gauntlets' manacles together as a swift action, the wearer can cause damage dealt by her wielded weapon to become lawful-aligned and thus overcome the corresponding damage reduction. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-round increments. By breaking the magical chain that connects the gauntlets as a standard action, the wearer can cause her wielded weapon to gain the anarchic weapon special ability for 7 minutes. Once broken, the chain between the gauntlets is shattered forever, and the gauntlets become non-magical.","13,200 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gauntlets-of-the-unchained
"Flail, Spine","This weapon looks like the barbed spine of a humanoid. A spine flail functions as a +2 flail that deals slashing damage and has reach. Unlike most weapons with reach, a spine flail can be used against adjacent foes. On a critical hit from a spine flail, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being permanently blinded by the blow. Spine flails are favored by powerful dullahans, who harvest the spines from their first victims. The undead riders have a particular affinity for their personal spine flails, and often maintain a supernatural control over their weapons, causing them to appear or disappear at will.","13,308 ",4,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/flail-spine
Mantle of Spores,"This mantle grants the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease. Once per day, the wearer can flourish the cape as a swift action to surround himself with a cloud of deadly spores. Creatures adjacent to the wearer take 1d6 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d3 points of damage per round for 3 rounds as the spores grow into fuzzy green mold. After these rounds the mold becomes harmless, and can be washed away with a minute of scrubbing. The spores can be destroyed by making a DC 15 Heal check on an affected creature, or by effects that remove diseases. The spores are a disease effect.","13,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mantle-of-spores
"Goggles, Discerning","This eyewear consists of two thick, gold-rimmed glass lenses encased in a leather band. When worn over the eyes, a pair of discerning goggles allows you to determine creatures' alignments with a single look. Good creatures appear to faintly glow blue and evil creatures to faintly glow red. Neutral-aligned creatures appear normal, as do creatures under the effect of an undetectable alignment spell or similar effect. These goggles function only during times when you normally would possess sight; for example, they do not work in darkness unless you possess darkvision.","13,500 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goggles-discerning
"Bracers, Arrowmaster’s","This simple pair of leather shooting bracers are designed to protect the wearer’s wrist from being snapped by bowstrings. They appear similar to a set of bracers of archery, but a wearer notices the difference as soon as she dons them. The wearer of these bracers gains damage reduction 5/magic against ranged weapons, as well as a +1 deflection bonus against ranged attacks. In addition, once per day, as a swift action, the wearer can grant herself a +20 insight bonus on her next ranged attack roll before the end of her next turn.","13,900 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracers-arrowmaster-s
Cape of Effulgent Escape,"This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts and continuously radiates light (as per the light spell, but only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per day, the wearer can command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). After triggering this burst, the wearer becomes invisible (as the invisibility spell, with a duration of 1 minute) and the cape’s light is extinguished as long as the wearer is invisible.","14,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cape-of-effulgent-escape
"Clasp, Woodsman's","This forest green clasp is engraved with a stylized version of a tree. If the wearer has the woodland stride ability, she gains the ranger's camouflage ability in forest terrain. If the wearer has an animal companion that also benefits from her woodland stride ability, the companion gains the camouflage ability as well.","14,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/clasp-woodsman-s
Sky Marines Elite Saddle,"Several alterations along the edges of this well-maintained leather saddle allow for the movement of a mount's wings. The saddle grants a mount wearing it a +5 competence bonus on Fly checks, and grants the rider a +5 competence bonus on Ride checks. If the rider is unsaddled during flight, he is immediately subject to a feather fall effect. The mount additionally gains the benefits of any teamwork feats the rider possesses.","14,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sky-marines-elite-saddle
Belt of Mighty Hurling (Lesser),"This thick leather belt is buckled with a bright bronze clasp in the shape of a fist. When worn, it grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and allows him to apply his Strength modifier as a bonus on attack rolls instead of his Dexterity modifier when making ranged attacks with thrown weapons. Also, the range increment of any weapon thrown by the wearer gains a +10-foot bonus. Treat this Strength bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.","14,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-of-mighty-hurling
Cape of Feinting,"This hooded cape is crafted from fine fabric with colorful embroidery and elegant weasel-fur trim. Three times per day, the wearer can spend a standard action to purposely miss an opponent, performing a dramatic feint that causes that opponent to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC until the wearer's next turn. If a swashbuckler wearing the cloak of feinting performs the superior feint deed or uses this cape's ability, the opponent is also dazed until the start of the swashbuckler's next turn if the foe fails a DC 13 Will save.","14,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cape-of-feinting
Cloak of Arachnida,"This red and violet silk garment, delicately embroidered with a barely perceptible web-like pattern, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a spider climb spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by web spells or webs of any sort; she can move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.","14,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-arachnida
"Cloak, Tentacle","Subtle, indefinable shapes ripple and flow when this deep blue cloak moves, seemingly devouring any light falling upon it. Once per day at the wearer’s command, two large gray tentacles emerge from the cloak near the shoulders. Each tentacle can make a natural attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage, assuming the wear is Medium (the damage of the tentacles scales by size of the wearer as a tentacle natural attack). The tentacles have 10-foot reach and the grab monster special ability. In addition, the wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on grapple maneuver checks with the tentacles. The tentacles last for 1 minute.","14,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-tentacle
Collar of Unliving Servitude,"This black iron choker chain forges a link between the wearer and any undead creature of the wearer's choice. Creating this link requires a command word. The wearer can dismiss this bond with another command word, and reforge it with the same or a different undead creature at a later time. While the two are bound and within 100 feet of one another, any positive energy damage the undead would take is instead transferred to the wearer as healing. Likewise, any negative energy damage the wearer would take transfers to and heals the undead. The collar can transfer up to 70 total points of damage per day.","14,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/collar-of-unliving-servitude

"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Glass Walrus","This figurine of wondrous power is shaped like a walrus and is carved out of a prismatic crystal. It follows all the normal rules for figurines of wondrous power. When animated, a glass walrus acts in all ways like a normal walrus except it can glide along the surface of water as though under the constant effects of water walk. Up to two Medium creatures or four Small creatures can fit on a glass walrus's back as the creature glides across water (the walrus moves at half speed while carrying creatures), and the walrus can carry up to 600 pounds in this way before it becomes too encumbered to move. A glass walrus can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the glass walrus again becomes a tiny statuette.","14,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/figurine-of-wondrous-power-glass-walrus
"Poncho, Gunfighter’s","The abjurations woven into this woolen poncho not only defend against gunfire, but also insulate the wearer from dangerous magic. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus to touch AC. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can negate a single ranged touch attack targeted at him, but cannot use this ability if the attack is a confirmed critical hit. When the wearer uses this ability, he must fall prone.","14,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/poncho-gunfighter-s
"Robe, Hamatulatsu","Made of exquisite crimson silk, this variant monk's robe is embroidered with golden pentagrams and other fiendish symbols. If the wearer is evil and has levels in monk, her AC bonus and unarmed damage are treated as if she were a monk of 5 levels higher (maximum 20). If the wearer is evil but does not possess monk class levels, she gains the AC bonus and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she doesn't add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus otherwise functions just like the monk's AC bonus. If the robe is donned by a character with the Hamatulatsu feat, the duration of the sickened effect increases to 2 rounds. If the wearer doesn't have the Hamatulatsu feat, she gains this feat while wearing the robes, but gains no further benefits to that ability.","14,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-hamatulatsu
Void Pennant,"This long tapering pennant resembles a stylized serpentine figure wearing a shimmering crown. The figure's claws function as clasps, attaching it to a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. The pennant has no effect when not mounted properly, or when activated by a lawfully aligned creature. Planting the pennant in the ground generates an area of twisted space around the flag out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1 round (a DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened). Any creature may end the effect by uprooting the pennant as a standard action. The pennant functions for 10 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.","14,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/void-pennant
Band of the Stalwart Warrior,"This plain iron band protects its wearer from fear effects. Whenever the wearer suffers a fear effect, she is merely shaken (even if the effect would normally make the target frightened or panicked). Furthermore, the subject gains a +2 competence bonus on all Will saves against fear. If the wearer has the bravery class feature, she is considered four levels higher when determining that class feature’s effect.","14,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/band-of-the-stalwart-warrior
"Pauldrons, Demonspike","These black iron pauldrons are studded with jagged spikes of various lengths. Demonspike pauldrons act as +2 armor spikes and also deal 1d2 bleed damage on a successful grapple attack or melee attack made with the pauldrons. If these pauldrons are worn with normal armor spikes, increase the damage done by the armor spikes to 1d6 (Small) or 1d8 (Medium), and use the greater of the two enhancement bonuses to attack and damage—either from the armor spikes (if any) or the demonspike pauldrons.","14,350 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pauldrons-demonspike
Vambraces of the Genie (Efreeti),"These bracers are decorated with icons representing air, earth, fire, or water, and depictions of genies appropriate to that element. The item protects the wearer against hot and cold environments as if she were using endure elements.

Bracelet of Bargaining,"This heavy gold band can be worn openly as a display of wealth or concealed beneath a sleeve. It grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. Whenever the wearer shakes hands with another creature in order to seal a deal or a promise, she can immediately sense whether deceit is involved (Will save DC 16 negates), though the wearer cannot determine the exact nature of the deception.","14,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracelet-of-bargaining
Pelt of the Wolf,"This pelt of a large northern wolf is fashioned into a cloak. The pelt can be activated up to five times per day. When struck in combat, the wearer can spend one use as a swift action to animate a ghostly wolf from the pelt. This ghostly apparition strikes the creature that attacked the wearer with a wolf's bite attack (a wolf deals 1d6+1 damage with their bite attack). The wearer can spend one additional use each subsequent round to have the wolf continue attacking the target. The apparition can't be redirected, and disappears if the target moves more than 5 feet of the wearer or dies. The pelt can manifest only one wolf apparition at a time. Apart from these restrictions, the wolf can be directed as a spiritual weapon spell. When a human wears a pelt of the wolf, he gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against emotion effects. In addition, any round in which he begins his turn affected by a fear effect, he can attempt a new save at the beginning of the turn to reduce the severity of the fear effect from panicked to frightened, frightened to shaken, or shaken to unaffected.","14,800 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pelt-of-the-wolf
Bag of Concealment (III),"A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size (it can hold 1000 lbs in 150 cubic ft), except for a few key points. Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only be keyed to one person at a time)—should the bag’s owner be killed, it becomes keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag’s outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag’s magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as non-magical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger goods may be hidden inside.","14,800 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-concealment
Stone Horse (Destrier),"This item is a roughly-hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind. A stone horse is combat-trained. A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem) or by casting stone to flesh, then using healing spells until it reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically returns to its stone form. ** (Destrier) - This item has the statistics of a heavy horse with hardness 10.","14,800 ",14,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-horse

The wearer can understand, speak, and read Dwarven. If the wearer is not a dwarf, he gains 60-foot darkvision, dwarven stonecunning, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against poison, spells, and spell-like effects.","14,900 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-of-dwarvenkind
Bracelet of Mercy,"This metal bracelet is set with multiple gems blessed by a priest. If the wearer has the lay on hands class feature, she can use it one additional time per day and is always treated as if she has the diseased mercy.

"Cloak, Quicksand","The exterior of the cloak is an extradimensional space filled with water and sand. Each time a creature of the wearer's size or smaller attempts to grapple the wearer, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fail at the attempt and be engulfed by quicksand. Every round it's trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others. A creature that fails its Swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown. A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to grapple the wearer again. A quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature were grappled. A quicksand cloak of any size can contain only one creature at a time; a creature attempting to grapple the wearer while the cloak already contains a body is not affected by the cloak.","15,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-quicksand
Floating Sail (15ft x 30ft),"This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating sail unfurls up to its full size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second time, the floating sail folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker (this space must be one that the floating sail was touching while unfurled). If the floating sail is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses and takes the form of a normal silk sail; depending on whether the sail was placed on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing on it may become entangled in the sail, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly, a floating sail immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed floating sail must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated again.[  Capacity (lbs.) - 1000  ]","15,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/floating-sail
Gloves of Dueling,"These supple gloves grant the wearer a +4 bonus to her CMD against disarm attacks, attempts to sunder her wielded weapons, and effects that cause her to lose her grip on her weapons (such as grease).

Amulet of the Abyss,"Each amulet of the Abyss bears a demon lord's rune on its face, indicating the lord to which the amulet is attuned. An amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol to the demon lord. For a worshiper of that demon lord, an amulet of the Abyss functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. An amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer the ability to cast all three spell-like abilities granted by the associated demon lord's first demonic boon, once per day per spell. See the individual demoniac prestige class for the spells each demon lord grants as a boon. Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains two negative levels.

Amulet of the Blooded (Aberrant),"Each different type of amulet of the blooded grants its wearer powers from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a blood-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers. [  Aberrant: This chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the light fortification armor special ability).

Treat the enhancement bonus to Constitution as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.

Gorget of Living Whispers,"Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this collar can speak a suggested course of action. Her words coalesce into a living whisper—a sinuous creature with blue runes lining its back—that appears in a square adjacent to her. The living whisper uses the statistics of a fiendish venomous snake, but has an Intelligence score of 3 and can communicate telepathically with the gorget's wearer. Instead of being poisoned, any creature bitten by the living whisper must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be affected by a suggestion spell (CL 9th).

Periapt of Wound Closure,"This stone is bright blue and dangles on a silver chain meant to be worn on the neck. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his hit points drop below 0 (but not if the damage is enough to kill the wearer).

This robe grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks and Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a weapon, and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. If worn by a slayer, the resistance bonus on saving throws increases to match the slayer's studied target bonus when he is facing a studied target. On command, the robe's wearer is able to turn into a brown mist (as the gaseous form spell) for up to 5 minutes per day.

Spy Eyes,"At first glance, spy eyes appear to be cat's-eye marbles. When activated, each comes to life and blinks, transforming into an eyeball. When pressed against an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface. Anyone holding an eye from a particular cluster of spy eyes can share the view from any other eye in the cluster as if that eye were her own, provided she is within 10 miles of that sensor. To recover a sensor, she can press a spy eye she holds from the same cluster against the one that's in sensor form to make the sensor emerge and return to marble form. A single bag of spy eyes contains five marbles (meaning that up to four may be deployed at any given time). Spy eyes in sensor form can be detected via the normal means for detecting scrying.","15,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spy-eyes

If the bracers' wearer succeeds, the stolen ioun stone embeds itself in one of the bracers' four available slots (each bracer has two). Embedded ioun stones provide their bonuses to the wearer and can be removed with a move action. As a standard action, the wearer can temporarily drain the power of any ioun stone that is embedded in the bracers and isn't dull gray, and can then channel that power to cast magic missile as a spell-like ability, firing three missiles at a target or targets up to 160 feet away. Drained ioun stones become dull gray for the next 2d4 hours.","15,000 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracers-ioun-spite

Ring of the Cacodaemon,"Sculpted into the intricate form of a golden cacodaemon, this ring’s wide-open mouth is designed to hold a soul gem created by a cacodaemon. The ring allows its wearer to tap into the residual memories of the mangled soul it encapsulates. Once per day, the wearer may interrogate the soul in the gem, similar to using speak with dead, except the soul answers telepathically. Once per day, the bearer can project the soul’s last tormented moments before it was consumed and bound, creating a cone of terror equivalent to a fear spell (DC 16).","15,000 ",8,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/ring-of-the-cacodaemon
Entwined Syrinx,"This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances made using the entwined syrinx. Anytime anyone attempts to play the entwined syrinx, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance— even if the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind instrument) — affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the entwined syrinx. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the character’s Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a bard, the DC increases to include 1/2 the bard’s level; the +2 Perform bonus is included).

"Gauntlets, Skullcrusher","These bloodstained gauntlets are made of a combination of blackened steel and polished white stone. They are slightly over-sized and somewhat bulky, though still suitable for combat. They function as +1 gauntlets. Once per day, the wearer can unleash a devastating attack with the gauntlets that can instantly knock a target unconscious. The wearer must announce her intent before making her attack roll, and creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected. To make the attack, the wearer makes a single melee attack at her highest base attack bonus as a full-round action. If the strike hits, the target takes 4d6 points of force damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or fall unconscious until the end of its next turn. Even if the target succeeds at the Fortitude save, it is staggered until the end of its next turn.

"Gloves, Whispering","These gloves constantly project a very short-range silence spell, so that anything touched or held by the wearer's hands makes no sound. Thus picking a locked door wouldn't make a clicking noise audible to those on the other side, and holding a hand over a victim's mouth would silence his scream. The silence extends only a few inches, so knocking on a door produces no sound but hammering it down still does. If the wearer presses a finger to her lips and speaks, no sound comes out, but the words are audible to anyone she chooses in her line of sight (as the message spell).","15,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-whispering

Furthermore, while the wearer is resting he regains twice his Hit Dice in hit points for 8 hours of rest instead of the typical 1 hit point per Hit Die.

Pelt of the Beast,"These lustrous animal pelts are particularly treasured among barbarians. While any humanoid creature can don and use such pelts, their powers are vastly enhanced for skinwalkers. All pelts of the beast grant the following powers: [  ** A bite attack that deals damage appropriate to the wearer's size. If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon; ** Speak with animals 1/day. If the wearer can already use speak with animals as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will; ** The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using beast shape I.  ] In addition, if the wearer is a skinwalker, her change shape ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the skinwalker heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear pelt of the beast could use her change shape ability to gain a climb speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to darkvision from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features. Feats or abilities that affect how many bestial features the skinwalker may gain at a single time stack with this ability. Each pelt also grants a competence bonus on a check, based on its type. These bonuses increase by 50% for skinwalkers wearing a pelt that matches their lycanthropic heritage. [  ** Bat: +4 bonus on Perception checks in darkness; ** Bear: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple; ** Boar: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to bull rush; ** Crocodile: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder; ** Rat: +2 bonus on saving throws against disease; ** Shark: +2 bonus on Perception and Swim checks attempted while completely underwater; ** Tiger: +2 bonus on Stealth checks; **Wolf: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to trip Other pelts of the beast may be available at the GM's discretion.  ]","15,600 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pelt-of-the-beast

Shawl of the Crone,"The yarn making up this knitted gray wrap is frayed and tattered. As soon as a creature puts on the shawl, she immediately takes the form of a venerable female of her race (regardless of the wearer’s actual gender) and remains so until the shawl is removed. Though this is an actual physical transformation, the wearer does not experience any infirmities due to advanced age, including penalties to her physical attributes, nor does she gain any bonuses to her mental attributes.

Bag of Tricks (Tan),"This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following table to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

Saddle of The Sky-River,"This nacreous saddle is carved from giant mollusk shells, lashed with braided kelp, and designed to be worn by aquatic mounts. On command, an arcing torrent of water rises up from an existing body of water, allowing the mount to use its swim speed to move through the air. This functions as air walk and can be used a total of 7 minutes per day, usable in 1-minute increments. The arc of water trails behind the mount and rider and can be used by other swimming creatures to move through the air (Swim DC 15). When the effect ends, the suspended water disappears with a negligible amount of water falling on creatures underneath the path of the arc. The sky-river created by the saddle does not harm creatures, though it does extinguish non-magical fires in areas it overlaps with them. As a standard action, the rider can expend 2 minutes of the sky-river's duration to produce a hydraulic torrent with a CMB of +9.","16,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/saddle-of-the-sky-river
"Bead, Boro (4th)","This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any one 4th level extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. A bead works on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or non-magical alchemical material such as antitoxin.","16,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bead-boro
Bracers of Celestial Intervention,"Prayers and engravings of celestial beings cover these golden bracers. A paladin can expend one or more of her uses of smite evil into these bracers as a standard action to call forth agathions, angels, or archons to aid her. This acts as a summon monster spell of a spell level equal to the number of smite evil uses the paladin expends. Outsiders summoned with the bracers must be from the list detailed in the summon monster spell or from the expanded summon monster list.","16,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracers-of-celestial-intervention
Halo of Inner Calm,"This silvery ring looks like a halo. When worn by a tiefling it hovers just above his head, though it still uses the head magic item slot. It helps to calm the baser emotions and the dark whispers that plague tieflings, granting the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against all spells with the emotion descriptor. When worn by a tiefling of a good alignment, it provides spell resistance 13 against spells with the evil descriptor and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws.","16,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/halo-of-inner-calm
Helm of the Valkyrie,"This shining helm glints with the multicolored hues of the aurora, and features wings carved of fine whalebone that sweep back from the temples. While it is in good shape, it shows signs of having seen battle. Once per day the wearer can summon a giant spectral wolf. Treat this as phantom steed cast by a 14th-level caster, but with an AC of 24 (–1 size, +8 natural armor, +7 Dexterity) and 100 hit points. The wolf can persist for up to 24 hours, as long as the creature that summoned it is still wearing the helm of the valkyrie. Even though it takes the form of a fierce predator and is more powerful than other phantom steeds, the mount is nothing more than mist and can't attack.","16,000 ",14,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-the-valkyrie

Page of Spell Knowledge (4th),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 4th level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","16,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (4th),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 4th level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day.

Runes of The Crone's Coven,"This leather pouch contains a set of black stones, each engraved with a different rune of ill fortune. When used as part of spell kenning, they allow the user to cast spells from the witch spell list. To cast a witch spell, the possessor must spend twice as long casting as for normal spell kenning, and must use a spell slot 1 level higher than normal. If the possessor has the master skald class feature, determine casting time as though he lacked that class feature instead of doubling casting time.

Spell Lattice (4th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","16,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice

Shackles of Durance Vile,"These masterwork iron manacles sap the will of their wearer. When they are attached to a humanoid creature as their command word is spoken, they affect their prisoner with a dominate person spell, except that if the prisoner fails its saving throw, the effect lasts for as long as the shackles are attached. Removing or destroying the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The shackles can be so used once per day. Shackles of durance vile can only be activated against a helpless, restrained, or willing creature; if attached to a creature still able to resist they function only as manacles, albeit superior ones.

Mute Marionette,"Every mute marionette appears as a hag with its lips sewn shut. The creator of a mute marionette chooses a creature type or subtype from the ranger's list of favored enemies to which the doll is attuned. If the doll's owner is within 30 feet of one or more creatures of the attuned type, the owner can shake the doll as a standard action. Creatures of the attuned type must attempt a DC 11 Will save; on a failure, for the next hour, affected creatures have a 10% chance of failing to cast spells or spell-like abilities as long as they remain within 30 feet of the doll. Regardless of the result of its save, a creature cannot be targeted by a mute marionette more than once per 24 hours. Once per day, a mute marionette can be presented forcefully to cast confusion (DC 16) at an area within 170 feet, affecting all creatures of the attuned type in a 15-foot-radius burst.","16,500 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mute-marionette
Skin Harp,"This small harp is made from a sprite's twisted, leathery corpse, its arms and legs arching up to hold the crossbar along the instrument's top. The strings are made from thin strips of twisted flesh flayed from the fey's torso and strung between their anchor points on the corpse and the crossbar. Though the corpse's chest cavity is clearly visible, all viscera have been removed. A skin harp functions as a masterwork harp. In addition, once per day, it can be activated to cast either command undead or dominate person (Will DC 19 negates). With a successful DC 20 Perform (string instruments) check, the save DC for this effect increases by +2.

In addition, once per day, the wearer can hold the eye of brokerage to one of her eyes for up to 7 rounds to determine whether up to seven creatures within 40 feet are lying (Will DC 16 negates), as discern lies.","16,550 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/eye-of-brokerage
"Bracers, Raven","This pair of magnificent dark metal bracers is forged to depict the shape of a raven stretched over the wearer’s forearm. Several additional raven bracers were created in the mines’ final days to aid the king’s bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications throughout the mine. While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round. This ability can be used three times a day. In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours. Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limit is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner’s hands via teleportation. If the item’s owner is no longer on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them for their own use.","16,600 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracers-raven

Symbol of Sanguine Protection,"This silver holy symbol rests just over the wearer’s heart, imbuing his blood with divine power. After wearing the amulet for 24 hours, the wearer can shed his own blood as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to himself, to collect an amount of divinely empowered blood that functions as a flask of holy water. The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual vials lose their potency after just 1 week. Undead creatures and evil outsiders that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save. Any benefit the creature might gain from drinking the wearer’s blood is negated due to the power of this symbol.","17,500 ",6,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/symbol-of-sanguine-protection
Pipes of Shifting Tempo,"In outer construction and manner of play, pipes of shifting tempo resemble a typical set of unremarkable pan pipes, but the complex chambers within the pipes are modeled after difficult-to-duplicate instruments. Music created by these pipes sounds unusually mournful, with a strange, almost warbling subtext to the notes. Up to three times per day, a user can attempt to harness these pipes’ power by making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check as a standard action. With a successful check, the possessor can play a grave melody to cast slow or an allegro melody to cast haste. The resulting spell functions as normal for the item’s caster level, affecting five creatures per casting.","18,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pipes-of-shifting-tempo

"Tattoo, Viper","This tattoo typically takes the form of a coiled snake, and once per day the bearer can activate it as a standard action. A viper tattoo must be visible to the bearer and must be touched as part of its activation. The tattoo is not normally placed on the head, neck, or back as a result, since most creatures would require mirrors to activate them. When activated, the snake tattoo animates and becomes a viper. It appears in the bearer's space and acts immediately, on the bearer's turn, and obeys the bearer's spoken commands for up to 5 rounds. The viper uses the bearer's base attack bonus when it attacks, and the DC to resist and cure its poison is equal to 10 + the 1/2 bearer's level + the bearer's Constitution modifier. If the bearer has a class feature or an ability that grants it precision damage (such as sneak attack), the viper's attack deals 1 additional point of damage per die of that precision damage. At the end of the 5 rounds, the viper vanishes and reverts to its tattoo form. If the viper is killed, the tattoo vanishes. As a swift action, the bearer can command the viper to withdraw from an opponent, and in this case, the viper returns to its tattoo form once it reaches the bearer's space.","18,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-viper

The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks while traveling in forested terrain, and can extend this bonus to up to 10 allies while they remain within 100 feet of the wearer.

Banner of the Ancient Kings,"This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud—a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner’s personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder’s deity). When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings—once he releases his firm grip on the banner’s haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner’s carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat, the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.","18,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-of-the-ancient-kings

"Crown, Cat’s Eye","This slender silver crown is decorated with a single cat’s eye gemstone as a centerpiece. When the gem is attached to the crown, its wearer gains darkvision 60 feet, or increases her darkvision by 60 feet if she already possesses that sense. The gemstone is detachable, and can be rolled into rooms, dropped into holes, thrown through windows, or planted on a creature. Once per day, on command, the crown’s wearer gains the benefit of the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell, but uses the cat’s eye gemstone as that spell’s sensor and gains darkvision when viewing through that sensor. If the stone is held or carried by a creature, even within a sack or some other container, the creature wearing the crown uses the senses of the creature carrying the gemstone as the sensor instead, whether or not the creature carrying the gemstone is aware of the stone’s true purpose or even its existence. Destroying the gem (hardness 8, hp 5) severs the link, but a new cat’s eye gemstone worth at least 100 gp can be fashioned and attuned to the crown.

Ebony Bolero,"Wisps of black smoke dance above these gray, fetchling-made pauldrons.

All sustained effects last as long as the wearer concentrates to maintain them or up to 1 minute. The effects of these shadowy tendrils can be ignored with a successful DC 16 Will save. An ebony bolero has 5 charges, which regenerate at dusk each day. Each of the following assaults uses 1 charge.

"Gloves, Vampiric","These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have blood-red stitching on the fingers—which bears a startling resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails. Three times per day, the wearer can use vampiric touch and bleed. If the wearer uses vampiric touch and holds the charge, the charge dissipates if the gloves are removed. Though vampiric touch is normally a touch attack, the wearer may instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, but only against a dying target or a target suffering from a bleed effect. When using vampiric touch in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a missed ranged touch attack. If the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may expend one use of vampiric touch to end the bleed effect.","18,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-vampiric

Mitre of the Heirophant,"This ostentatious hat functions only for a wearer who can cast divine spells. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (religion) checks. Once per day on command, the wearer can ask a single question of her patron deity, as if by using commune. Once per week on command, the wearer can touch a creature, atoning it for past misdeeds as if using an atonement spell.","18,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mitre-of-the-heirophant
Orb of Foul Abaddon,"This grapefruit-sized sphere of glossy black stone glows with faint whorls of orange fire deep within its inky substance. When held in hand, it can be commanded to unleash a dread bolt once per day. When used as an additional focus for casting a spell with the evil descriptor, the bearer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level for these spells. It bestows one permanent negative level on any good creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb.","18,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-foul-abaddon
Spirit Planchette (Silver),"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist—brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface—it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette’s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board—at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the séance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below.  The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day—the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a –2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient—the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically “maybe.” If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie. [  (Questions per Use) - (Will save DC) - (Confusion Duration) - (True Answer) - (Lie): 5 - 19 - 3 round - 01–90 - 91-100  ]","18,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spirit-planchette
Trophy Box,"A trophy box is a 1-foot-wide clay box used to trap and release beasts too dangerous to confront directly. As soon as the trophy box is placed and the first command word is spoken, the trap is rigged to trigger whenever a Medium or larger animal comes within 20 feet of the box. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be drawn into an extradimensional space within the box, where it is held in a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours. A trophy box can hold only one such victim at a time. The first command word can be used once per day. If the second command word is spoken, any animal trapped within the trophy box appears adjacent to the box either immediately or when a Tiny or larger creature (other than the user) comes within 20 feet (user's choice). A creature within 20 feet that speaks the password (set when the box is first activated) does not trigger the box. If the user is within 50 feet of the released animal, she can control it for 1 minute after its release as the dominate animal spell. Otherwise, the released animal attacks the nearest creature for 1 minute, after which its normal instincts take over.","18,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trophy-box
Tuned Bowstring,"This faintly glowing bowstring is twined from the hair of a lillend. When strung on a bow, a tuned bowstring also functions as a masterwork stringed instrument, granting the wielder an enhancement bonus on Performance (string) checks equal to the bow's enhancement bonus (if any). A tuned bowstring produces a perfect note with every arrow fired by its wielder, allowing a character with the bardic performance class feature to maintain a performance in combat without expending rounds of bardic performance as long as she fires at least one arrow each round. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a different performance still costs a round of bardic performance.","18,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tuned-bowstring
Wayfinder of the Planes,"This wayfinder is made of magically hardened glass, through which the complex inner matrix of the compass can be seen. Once per day, the wielder of a wayfinder of the planes can choose one of the following alignments: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. For 1 hour thereafter, the wayfinder of the planes creates a magic circle effect against the chosen alignment, centered on the wayfinder. Once selected, the alignment of the magic circle effect can't be changed until the effect recharges the next day.","18,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-of-the-planes

Runestone of Power (3rd),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 3rd level.","18,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1

When donned in forest or jungle terrain, a moss cloak gives the wearer a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In any terrain, the wearer can remove a single poison currently affecting him once per day as a standard action. This causes the moss to turn a sickly shade of brown as it draws the toxins from the wearer's body, negating the Stealth bonus until the cloak heals itself 24 hours later.","18,700 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-moss

Upon close inspection, a keyhole is visible on the side of the barrel, where a good lock is inset. The chest's interior can hold up to 6 cubic feet of material. The chest can be ridden by a single Medium creature or two Small creatures, and is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (with a +5 bonus on Fly checks) for up to 10 hours per day, split up as its owner desires. The chest can carry up to 300 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 600 pounds at a speed of 30 feet.

Idol of the Eye,"This squat, golden idol looks like a bald, obese wise man with an extra eye in his forehead. It can be used once per day to gain information as with an augury spell, and once per day as a divination spell. Once per week, a single yes-or-no question can be asked of it (as with a commune spell). The answers do not come from a deity, but instead from insights granted by celestial movements and conjunctions; a sample insight might be, “Because Aballon and Eox are in conjunction in the House of the Eagle, the answer is yes.”","19,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/idol-of-the-eye

First, up to 10 cubic feet of food or drink that it touches per day is affected as if a purify food and drink spell had been cast upon the food or drink. Second, once per day, if placed in the mouth of a creature (as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), the pearl acts as a neutralize poison spell cast on that creature (caster level 10th).","19,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-purifying-pearl
Bracelet of Friends,"This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to each charm.

When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) appearing at the user’s location along with his gear, as long as the bracelet’s owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless.

The wearer can breathe underwater and gains a swim speed of 20 ft. While the wearer is submerged, the cape surrounds her with tiny stinging tentacles. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to the wearer takes 1 point of electricity damage and must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be sickened for 1 round.

Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. When the wearer animates the belt as a venomous or constrictor snake, she may speak a second command word to give the snake the advanced, celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute simple template.

As a full-round action, the wearer can spin in his space, damaging each creature within 5 feet. This attack uses the wearer’s highest base attack bonus against each creature, and deals 2d6 damage on a hit. The wearer is considered proficient with this attack.

Floating Sail (15ft x 40ft),"This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating sail unfurls up to its full size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second time, the floating sail folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker (this space must be one that the floating sail was touching while unfurled). If the floating sail is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses and takes the form of a normal silk sail; depending on whether the sail was placed on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing on it may become entangled in the sail, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly, a floating sail immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed floating sail must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated again.[  Capacity (lbs.) - 1250  ]","20,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/floating-sail

A person with the favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4 rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on this save equal to the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic.

Necrograft (Sallowflesh),"This necrograft weaves strips of rotted skin across the bearer's body in a grisly process of scarification. The dense, undead hide provides a +2 enhancement bonus to its host's natural armor bonus, and causes undead creatures to perceive the host as one of their own— skeletons, zombies, and other mindless undead ignore a character implanted with sallowflesh unless attacked first. Intelligent undead may also be fooled by this effect, but can recognize the host as a living creature with a successful DC 11 Will save; on a failed save, the undead assumes the host to be another intelligent undead. Undead attacked by the host, or that witness the host channel positive energy, can immediately see through this effect.

Amulet of Magecraft,"A universalist wizard who selects the amulet as his bonded object may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chose “evocation” when he prepared his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared fireball into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.","20,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-magecraft
"Amulet, Dragonfoe","This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The dragonfoe amulet is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways. The wearer of a dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result.

Bag of Concealment (IV),"A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size (it can hold 1500 lbs in 250 cubic ft), except for a few key points. Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only be keyed to one person at a time)—should the bag’s owner be killed, it becomes keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag’s outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag’s magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as non-magical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger goods may be hidden inside.","20,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-concealment

Carpet of Flying (5x5),"This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell of unlimited duration. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions. A carpet of flying can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. a carpet of flying can hover without making a Fly skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other Fly checks.

Charm of Aluum Control,"This pendant holds a glowing crystal exactly like that of an aluum. If you are attuned to the charm, when you wear it you may give orders to any generic aluum within 100 feet; the construct obeys you as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. If multiple aluum are within range, they all obey unless you specify which construct you are commanding. The aluum cannot resist your commands, though they will not harm other aluum, the pactmasters, or an attuned person wearing a charm. Unlike dominate person, you cannot use an aluum’s senses. If multiple people give orders to the same aluum, you make opposed Will saves to control the golem.

"Charm, Halflight Greater","This item is associated with a particular group. While regular halflight charms are temporarily issued to anyone traversing under the guidance of the associated group, greater halflight charms are given to those who have saved the life of a representative of the associated group or who has performed a great service for the organization. They thus carry great social cachet with members of the associated group, who consider selling or purchasing one to be a grave insult. A greater halflight charm is a dark blue crystal amulet embossed with a golden arch and suspended from a black cord. When worn, it grants the wearer darkvision 60 feet. It also grants a +2 bonus on all initiative checks made while in underground areas. In addition, once per year, the wearer can call on the amulet to summon the specific representative on whom the charm was imprinted at its creation, who is instantly teleported to an adjacent square along with his standard adventuring gear, provided the wearer is on the same plane. The summoned individual is not bound to the caster's will in any way however.","20,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/charm-halflight-greater
Cloak of the Diplomat,"The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. In addition, once per day, before making a Diplomacy or Sense Motive check, the wearer can decide to call upon the powers of the cloak to roll twice and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak can adjust a creature’s attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy, instead of the normal limit of two steps. However, the cloak’s power does have one drawback.

"Hat, Magician’s","Mystic symbols embroidered in gold thread decorate this conical hat. Three times per day as a free action when casting a spell, the wearer can shift metamagic feats on prepared spells. The wearer can either move a metamagic feat from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from the spell being cast to another prepared spell. In either case, the spell that gains the metamagic feat can’t exceed the spell slot of the spell that originally had the metamagic feat. For example, a wizard with detect thoughts, silent dispel magic, and dimension door prepared could cast a silent detect thoughts (and would now have dispel magic prepared), but could not cast silent dimension door. Moving metamagic feats does not increase spell casting time, even for quickened spells. The hat provides no benefit to spontaneous casting or spell-like abilities.","20,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hat-magician-s

Lambent Window,"This small pane of glass in a frame made of black metal looks like a small hand mirror at first glance, but when a creature spends at least 1 minute staring into its reflection, the image shifts and changes, showing the landscape of another plane. If the lambent window is activated on the Material Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the Shadow Plane, along with any creatures at that location. Likewise, when used on the Shadow Plane, it shows the corresponding location on the Material Plane. This item only allows those staring into it to see the corresponding location on the other plane; they cannot hear through or gain other sensual information about the other side by way of the window. This effect can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. Those minutes need not be consecutive, and the 1 minute it takes to activate the lambent window does not count against this limit. A person holding an active lambent window can use it as a special focus when casting plane shift or using plane shift as a spell-like ability to reach the specific location shown in the mirror, rather than 5–500 miles from the bearer's intended destination.","20,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lambent-window
"Robe, Xorn","This brown and gray robe is always dirty, and the chest and the back of each shoulder is decorated with a gem-like eye pattern. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Perception checks, and can use earth glide to pass through up to 20 feet of natural or worked stone per day. The distance traveled with earth glide does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments. The wearer is able to safely chew, swallow, digest, and derive nutrition from gems, precious metals, and metallic ore, with 100 gp worth of these materials sustaining him for 1 full day. If the wearer removes the robe after such a meal, he is sickened until 24 hours have passed since the last meal of this kind. Wearing the robe again immediately negates this penalty.","20,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-xorn
Third Eye,"The practice of third eye magic has a long-standing tradition among a Vudran mystical organization known as the Daughters of the Blinding Night. A practitioner of this mysterious sect visited Bahor and Vimanda some years ago to grant them this magic in return for a wealth of magic and secrets the Arkonas stole from the Acadamae. As part of the process of gaining a third eye, the creator grafts an actual eye into the palm of the recipient’s hand. Generally human eyes are used, but any eye harvested from a creature the same size as the recipient will do. Once an eye is grafted into a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn’t hinder the user’s manual dexterity in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens. The owner of a third eye can use it to see through the donor creature’s remaining eye. The third eye can also be attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things in that stone’s vicinity as if it were an eye as well. Preparing a bloodstone in this manner requires it to soak in a potion of clairvoyance/clairaudience for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone into the hand bearing the third eye. These bloodstones are often incorporated into magic items like phylacteries, rings, or amulets, allowing the user to gift such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing ability functions at any range while on the same plane. It also allows the user to cast clairaudience/clairvoyance up to three times per day. As long as the third eye is open in a hand that isn’t holding an object, the creature gains all-round vision, granting a +4 bonus on Perception checks and making it impossible to flank them. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards, can use the powers of their third eyes while holding an object since the eye effectively looks out of the “back” of their hand. A third eye cannot be transferred between creatures—if removed from the owner’s body, the third eye is destroyed. A third eye that remains in the owner’s palm but is damaged or otherwise permanently blinded becomes useless until a remove blindness spell is cast upon it.","20,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/third-eye
Trapmaker's Sack,"This heavy leather bag bulges only slightly but upon closer inspection appears to be chocked full of knives, gears, picks, shovels, and arrows. Once per day as a full-round action, the bearer can command the sack to create any mechanical trap of CR 4 or less, which appears at a designated spot within 50 feet. The bearer must make a Craft (traps) check with a DC equal to the normal DC for creating the trap. If successful, the trap instantly merges with the chosen area, exactly as if someone had actually built the trap in that spot. If the check fails, no trap appears. The sack can alter earth, stone, and wood to accommodate the trap without altering nearby terrain (including doors, pits, and so on).","20,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/trapmaker-s-sack
Vest of Stable Mutation,"This leather vest is fitted with a number of pockets that are useful for storing the ingredients necessary for alchemical tinkering. The main ability of this vest, however, is to lessen the debilitating effects of an alchemist’s mutagen. While under the effect of any type of mutagen, the wearer takes no penalty to mental ability scores from that mutagen.","20,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/vest-of-stable-mutation
Ampoule of False Blood,"This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule’s bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer’s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged). The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed. As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer’s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule’s bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer’s bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline’s bonus feat list.","20,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/ampoule-of-false-blood
"Circlet, Moon Circlet","This fine silver circlet typically has a carved moonstone inset on the front or a crescent moon design. The wearer of a moon circlet gains darkvision out to 60 feet (if she does not already possess it). Its other effects only benefit a wearer capable of casting arcane spells. During the waxing moon, the wearer's caster level is considered one higher for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects; during the three nights of the full moon, this benefit increases to two levels higher than normal. However, this additional power comes with a price. During the waning moon, the wearer's caster level is considered one lower for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects, and during the three nights of the new moon, this penalty increases to two levels lower. Removing a moon circlet imposes 2 negative levels on the wearer until the next full moon (or until the circlet is worn again, whichever comes first). These negative levels cannot be restored by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle.","20,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/circlet-moon-circlet
Demon Senses,"This implant appears as a demonic eye, tongue, finger, ear, or nose floating in a small jar of transparent fluid. In order to gain the benefit of this implant, the contents of the jar—thick fluid, body part, and all—must be consumed as a full-round action. This immediately grants a permanent +8 racial bonus on all Perception checks (note that as a racial bonus, this does not stack with any other racial bonuses a creature might already possess). After gaining this bonus, the part of the creature’s body corresponding to the body part eaten changes to match the eaten part—eyes might become red, ears might grow long and pointed, a tongue might become forked, and so on.","20,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/demon-senses
Demon Talon,"A demon talon must be held against the raw flesh of a fresh stump—preparing a creature by severing an existing hand causes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, but preparing a preexisting stump by cutting the flesh free at the end causes no significant damage. Once attached, the demon talon fuses with the stump, granting the creature a claw attack as appropriate for a creature one size category larger than the target’s actual size. The claw is shaped like a human hand (fingers and a thumb), but looks obviously demonic (scales, strange coloration, long nails, and so on), and is fully capable of wielding weapons or performing any other feat a human hand can perform.","20,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/demon-talon
Headband of Arcane Energy,"This headband has three swirling patterns of red, green, and blue crystals arching across its length. Three times per day, its wearer can sacrifice an arcane spell to create an offensive blast or defensive shield. The blast is a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, which deals 1d6 points of energy damage (cold, electricity, or fire) per spell level sacrificed. The shield creates a swirling band of energy that lasts 1 round and gives the wearer a deflection bonus to AC equal to 2 + the level of the spell sacrificed.","20,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-arcane-energy
Headband of Counterspelling,"This metal headband grants a +5 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify a spell as it is being cast. Furthermore, once per day the wearer can attempt to counter a spell by casting the appropriate spell as an immediate action instead of doing so with a readied action. The wearer must first identify the spell being cast before countering a spell with this headband.","20,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-counterspelling
"Ioun Stone, Pale Lavender Ellipsoid","This stone absorbs spells of 4th level or lower. After absorbing 20 spell levels, the stone burns out and turns to dull gray, forever useless.

Master's Perfect Golden Bell,"This lustrous golden bell produces a deep and resonant ring which vibrates in perfect harmony with the Material Plane and destructively interferes with otherworldly beings. These vibrations reduce the damage reduction and spell resistance of all extraplanar creatures within 30 feet by 5 (for example, changing DR 10/magic to DR 5/magic). The bell has no clapper; to ring it, the bearer must attack it with an unarmed strike (this counts as an attack, with no attack roll needed, and does not damage the bell). The ringing lasts 1d6 rounds; stifling the ringing early is a standard action. It can ring for a maximum of 10 rounds per day.","20,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/master-s-perfect-golden-bell
Necromancer's Athame,"This pallid length of sharpened thighbone is carved into the shape of a dagger, but with tiny holes bored into it at equal intervals, almost like a flute. A necromancer who selects the athame as his bonded object can use it to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard necromancy spell into any other wizard necromancy spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell.","20,000 ",11,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necromancer-s-athame
Portable Hole,"A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item. The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process. Editor's Note: Portable hole uses the terms 'nondimensional' and 'extradimensional' interchangeably which suggests they are just different terms for the same concept.","20,000 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/portable-hole
Music Box Trap,"A silhouette of a miniature dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect. The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target. Closing the music box trap is a move action. If the music box is closed before its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the music box trap to await the next creature to open the box.","20,160 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/music-box-trap
Amulet of Grappling,"This nearly perfect pearl replica of a hand is attached to a gold chain and can be worn as an amulet. Once per day, the wearer can animate the hand as an immediate action. The hand attempts to grapple an adjacent foe of Medium size or smaller, using the wearer’s CMB. If it succeeds, the hand deals 1d4 non-lethal damage every round it maintains a grapple. If the grapple attempt fails or the victim escapes the grapple, the hand ceases its activity. If any creature within reach of the amulet (including the wearer) attempts to steal anything, the hand activates and attempts to choke the creature. If the amulet is not currently worn, it uses the victim’s own CMB and Strength to determine the attack bonus and damage.","20,258 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-grappling
"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Ivory Goats","These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function: [ ** The Goat of Traveling: this statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. ** The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. ** The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.  ]","21,000 ",?,?,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/ivory-goats
Belt of Fallen Heroes,"This large brass belt has three panels depicting scenes of battle. Once per day on command, the wearer can summon the spirit of a hero of one of the depicted battles. This spirit acts as an unseen servant, though unlike the force created by that spell, the summoned hero is not entirely mindless. While the summoned hero is active, it attempts to guide its wearer to victory via telepathic warning and advice, granting its user a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws.","21,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-of-fallen-heroes

"Tattoo, Caster’s (Normal)","A caster’s tattoo is infused with potential magical energy that aids in casting spells that normally utilize verbal and somatic components. Once per day, a spellcaster may activate her caster’s tattoo as a swift action to automatically enhance the next spell she casts in that round with both the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. When she casts the spell, the caster’s tattoo flares with light for a moment, then grows faint and faded—it replenishes its energy in 24 hours, after which it becomes bold and colorful and can be used again. Required material components or foci must be in the creature’s possession to cast the spell (and are consumed as normal), but need not be held when the spell is cast. Allows the modified casting of a spell of up to 6th level.","21,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-caster-s
Amulet of Grasping Souls,"This amulet can be worn by both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. If worn by a corporeal creature, it confers the ghost touch special ability on her natural attacks and weapons she wields (even thrown weapons and projectiles). Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can make the next spell she casts affect incorporeal creatures as though she were using the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat but without increasing the spell level. When an incorporeal creature wears the amulet, it can interact with it surroundings. Any item in its possession becomes incorporeal, allowing the incorporeal creature to take items and phase through objects with them. An incorporeal creature without a Strength score uses its Charisma score to determine how much it can carry.","21,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-grasping-souls

Rope of Entanglement,"A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. A rope of entanglement has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.","21,000 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/rope-of-entanglement
"Helm, Tri-Faced","Crafted of overlaid bronze, steel, and chain, each tri-faced helm is a work of art. These exotic helmets possess three stylized faces, each serene visage staring in a different direction (with the wearer’s face concealed behind the central sculpted plate). The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction, granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus on all vision-based Perception checks. One in every 10 tri-faced helms is an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak a language, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble, knowledgable of many deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend holy places and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any of the helm's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will.","22,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helmet-vudran-ashak
Weirding Watch,"This gold-plated watch is divided into five pieces. The weirding watch keeps flawless time without ever needing to be wound or repaired. In addition, the bearer of any piece of the watch can activate it to exercise power over time for herself and her allies. Once a watch piece is activated, the bearer gains the benefits of haste and lesser age resistance for 3 rounds. Anyone bearing a piece from the same weirding watch within 30 feet receives the same effect. Each piece of the watch can be activated once per day. The price of a weirding watch includes all five pieces. Pieces are rarely sold separately.","22,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/weirding-watch
Arcane Battery,"An arcane battery is a fist-sized lead container—typically a sphere, pyramid, or cylinder—that stores magically treated saltwater. When affixed to the head of a magical staff with the attached lashings, an arcane battery increases the maximum number of charges the staff can hold to 11 (instead of 10). An attached arcane battery also allows the wielder of a staff to imbue a staff with up to two charges per day. In order to do so, the wielder must expend two prepared spells or spell slots that meet the prerequisites for recharging a staff. A staff may only have a single arcane battery attached to it, and an arcane battery must be adjoined to a staff for 24 hours before its powers are attuned to the staff. If an arcane battery is removed from a staff by the staff's wielder, it must be reattached and remain so for 24 hours before it's attuned again.","22,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/arcane-battery
Circlet of Mindsight,"This elaborate circlet of gold-and-platinum filigree bears tiny gems in settings that look disturbingly like human eyes. When worn, the circlet lets the wearer sense the presence of other thinking creatures in her immediate area. The wearer gains the benefits of blindsense 30 feet, but only against creatures with an Intelligence score that are susceptible to mind-affecting effects. Undead, constructs, and mindless creatures like most oozes and vermin cannot be perceived when using the circlet, nor can creatures under the effects of mind blank or a ring of mind shielding. The circlet does not interfere with the wearer’s ability to see normally.

Corset of Dire Witchcraft,"This slimming garment is fastened with laces, buckles, and buttons and reinforced with ribs of leather or bone. A corset of dire witchcraft grants a +4 armor bonus to AC. If the wearer is a witch, each day when she communes with her familiar to prepare spells, she may enhance one hex she knows, increasing its caster level by +2 for 24 hours.

Harp of Storms,"This small harp is carved from whale ivory, and its frame is filigreed with delicate gold patterns depicting winds and clouds. Up to three times per day as a standard action, you can use a harp of storms to surround yourself with an aura of brisk wind that grants you a 20% miss chance against all ranged attacks. This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the harp of storms in order to produce one of the following three effects. [  ** Air Walk: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an air walk spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action; ** Gust of Wind: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a gust of wind spell. This is a standard action; ** Lightning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check.

Orb of Golden Heaven,"This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a continual flame spell. Making a melee touch attack with the orb has the same effect as dousing the target with a flask of holy water. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and command it to invoke consecrate and searing light each once per day. The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb. If the bearer of an orb of golden heaven wears a crown of golden heaven, its light counts as daylight instead of continual flame, and its consecrate acts as if the orb were a shrine to the bearer's deity.","22,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-golden-heaven

Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated. ** Stone Golem Manual: The book contains geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, and slow. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem. Strong abjuration and enchantment; CL 14th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 14th, antimagic field, geas/quest, limited wish, symbol of stunning.","22,000 ",14,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-golem-manual
Mask of the Skull,"This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn. Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points of damage, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.","22,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mask-of-the-skull
Mist Projector,"This strange device appears to be a twisted rod crafted of some unknown alloy of metal and crystal. The device requires two hands to use. When activated, the mist projector discharges a 60-foot cone of supercooled mist. This functions as cone of cold, dealing 10d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area (DC 17 Reflex save for half ). Once fired, a cloud of mist persists in the area of effect for 1d10 minutes or until dispersed, functioning as a fog cloud. A mist projector normally contains 27 charges. A mist projector is impossible to recharge without special technology.","22,500 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mi-go-mist-projector
"Helm, Howling","The wearer of this helm, crafted from a beast’s skull, gains the ability to communicate with dogs, wolves, dire wolves, foxes, jackals, coyotes, and similar canine animals as the speak with animals spell. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks and Charisma checks to influence wolf-like magical beasts such as blink dogs, winter wolves, and worgs. On command three times per day, the wearer can unleash a terrifying howl. When he does so, he makes a single Intimidate check to demoralize all opponents within 30 feet that can hear the howl. At the start of the wearer’s following turn, 1d3 wolves appear as if summoned by the spell summon nature’s ally III. They act on the wearer’s initiative and follow her instructions (or attacking her opponents, if she cannot communicate with them) for 5 rounds before vanishing in a swirl of pine needles and snow.","22,600 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-howling
Visage of the Bound,"Crafted from gold and lacquer, these elaborate masks resemble various outsiders. Once per day when the wearer casts a summon monster spell, he may choose to house the summoned outsider within the visage of the bound rather than conjuring it onto the Material Plane. For the spell's duration, the wearer can use of any of the bound outsider's spell-like abilities as if they were his own. A visage of the bound has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells cast by other creatures. Removing the mask immediately releases a bound outsider. The wearer cannot use the bound outsider's spell-like abilities to summon other creatures, and a summoner cannot activate a visage of the bound while his eidolon is summoned. Effects that extend the duration of a summon monster spell (such a the Extend Spell metamagic feat or the conjurer's summoner's charm class ability) have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a visage of the bound. Outsiders who are opposed to one or more axes of the wearer's alignment cannot be housed within a visage of the bound.","22,900 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/visage-of-the-bound

Furthermore, once per day on command, its wearer can spew a 60-foot cone of poisonous green gas as a breath weapon. Any creature caught in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 18 saving throw to resist its effect, but if the creature fails the saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. At the end of its turn, a creature petrified by this breath weapon can attempt a new save to end the paralysis effect. Treat the enhancement bonus to Strength as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.","23,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-gorgon
Glove of Familiar's Touch,"A glove of familiar's touch features a large, brightly colored gem fastened to its palm, and comes with an additional gem attuned to the glove. As long as his familiar is touching the attuned gem, the wearer of this glove can designate his familiar as the source for any touch spell he casts, even if he and his familiar are not in contact when the spell is cast. A glove of familiar's touch takes up the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can't gain the benefits of another magic item (even another glove of familiar's touch) that also uses the hands slot.","23,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/glove-of-familiar-s-touch
Mattock of the Titans,"This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes).

Angel's Clarion,"An angel's clarion is a graceful trumpet whose bell unfolds like the petals of a flower. These trumpets are usually platinum or silver near the mouthpiece, transforming to a rose gold at the bell. Three times per day when an angel's clarion is sounded, it releases a blast that sounds like the chiming, resonant voices of an angelic choir. Any good-aligned creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5 points of damage. This energy only affects good-aligned creatures; neutral and evil creatures receive no benefit and undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in seconds. Any evil-aligned creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be treated as if in the area of an entangle spell. The entangling flowers persist for 5 minutes.","23,400 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/angel-s-clarion

Cloak of Displacement (Minor),"This item appears to be a normal cloak, with a pattern very similar to a major cloak of displacement’s nocturnal designs, but when worn its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the blur spell, granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually.","24,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-displacement
"Gauntlets, Inphidian","Inphidian gauntlets are leather or metal gauntlets that provide a creature (normally an inphidian) with limbs but without humanoid hands a set of fully functional hands.  When wearing these gauntlets, the creature can manipulate items normally considered unusable (because the creature lacks hands).  The wearer can use its full Strength and Dexterity while wearing these gauntlets.  An inphidian cannot use its hand-snake bite attacks while wearing inphidian gauntlets.  These gauntlets serve no purpose to creatures with humanoid hands. These gauntlets are manufactured by inphidian craftsmen and are virtually unknown outside the inphidian community.","24,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gauntlets-inphidian
Helm of Underwater Action,"The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer's eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.","24,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-underwater-action
"Locket, Eye-Stealing","This silver locket is suspended from a silver chain. As a standard action, a creature holding the locket can speak a command word to attempt to steal the sight of one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or its eyes are immediately sealed within the locket’s interior and replaced with featureless, shadowy orbs, causing the creature to be permanently blinded. The wielder can speak a second command word to return the victim’s eyes; otherwise, this blindness cannot be removed except by miracle or wish. Each eye-stealing locket can contain only a single set of eyes at a time, and the creature in possession of the locket is treated as having a body part of the creature to whom the eyes belong for the purpose of spells such as scrying. If the wielder is a mesmerist and he uses an eye-stealing locket against the target of his hypnotic stare, he can apply the Will saving throw penalty from his hypnotic stare to the Fortitude saving throw the target attempts to prevent its eyes being stolen.","24,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/locket-eye-stealing
"Tattoo, Penumbra","This ritualistic scar is infused with shadowstuff that shifts and writhes within the bearer’s skin. Whenever the bearer is exposed to illumination brighter than dim light, the tattoo emits a vapor, shrouding the bearer in a dusky haze that provides the benefits of protective penumbra.","24,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/tattoo-penumbra
"Belt, Earth Elemental","This belt is constructed of flat pieces of slate connected with strong leather straps. This belt grants its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and the wearer is immune to effects that would push, pull, or forcefully move the wearer. This offers no protection from teleportation effects. Furthermore, once per day on command, the wearer can take the form of a Large earth elemental, as though subject to the elemental body III spell. Treat the enhancement bonus to Constitution as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.","24,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-earth-elemental
"Chest, Corsair's Coffer","This huge-sized lacquered chest is bound in gold-plated steel, with three hasps for securing locks and spade-shaped feet. The chest is airtight when closed, and can be commanded to bury itself in dirt, loose soil, or sand. Once per day, the chest can burrow down between 10 and 30 feet. The process takes 1 minute for every 10 feet the chest travels. The chest stops digging once it reaches the desired depth, if it encounters solid stone, or if its path is blocked by any other obstruction. A buried chest can be commanded to dig back to the surface by a creature standing within 5 feet of the location beneath which it buried itself. The chest doesn't leave a usable tunnel, nor does it dig any direction other than down or back up. The chest opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. This allows the chest to hold a large volume of material, to a maximum of 3,000 pounds and 500 cubic feet. The contents of the chest don't change its weight. Any effort to overload the chest fails, and items must be drawn from the chest intentionally; it's not possible to tip the chest over and spill its contents. Retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. As with the secret chest spell, magic items placed inside a corsair's coffer don't offer any benefit to characters carrying it. The chest is treated as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining what happens if placed in another extradimensional or non-dimensional space. There's enough air for living creatures placed within the chest to survive for 20 minutes, after which time they begin to suffocate.","24,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chest-corsair-s-coffer
Drinking Horn of Bottomless Valor,"This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges—charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits: [ ** 1 charge: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an aid spell), which last for 1 minute. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion—it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required).; ** 2 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell enlarge person, for 5 minutes. To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes an attack of opportunity; ** 3 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a heroism spell for as long as she is enlarged. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn  ] A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit.","24,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/drinking-horn-of-bottomless-valor

In forest terrain, the wearer leaves no tracks or scent and gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks.

Bracers of Archery (Greater),"These bracers look like normal protective wear. They empower the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use.

Eyes of Doom,"These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.

Hand of Hoarded Deaths,"The wearer of this single, black silk glove can use death knell on command. The target of death knell dies if it fails a DC 13 Fortitude save as normal, but the glove's wearer does not immediately benefit from the death; instead the siphoned life energy is stored inside the glove.

The wearer can tap into these deaths anytime thereafter by touching herself with the glove as a swift action, granting her death knell's benefits with a duration of 10 minutes. She can spend more than one death at a time, if she wishes. Temporary hit points from multiple deaths stack, but the bonuses to caster level and Strength do not.

To do so, he rolls an unarmed strike against the opponent, including any applicable modifiers such as a favored enemy bonus or the penalty for Power Attack. If his attack roll is greater than the opponent’s attack roll, the attack is negated without effect. The unarmed strike itself causes no damage and does not count as a successful attack against the opponent. The opponent does not need to be within the wearer’s reach to use this ability.

A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell.

If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list.

Spell Lattice (5th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell.

When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll.

If the target is a creature of the wearer’s size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him. If the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet toward the target.

Iron Bands of Binding,"This potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe. When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.","26,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/iron-bands-of-binding
"Jars, Spirit","Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell’s need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within a Spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within a Spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar’s holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within a Spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.","26,250 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/jars-spirit
Bracelets of Stone,"These rugged stone armbands slip on easily and swiftly adjust to a size appropriate for the wearer. Once per day, the wearer can create a wall of stone up to 2 inches thick and 45 feet long (or 90 feet long, if the thickness is reduced to 1 inch). For the purpose of this effect, the bracelets of stone count as a stone surface that the wall of stone can merge with, and they magically provide the wearer the strength necessary to support any wall of stone so created. Thus, the wearer can create a bridge or wall in nearly any location as long as he is standing adjacent to a point where the bracelets can connect to it. If the bracelets are used this way, the wearer can't move from this space and is considered flat-footed during this time, but may end the effect as an immediate action (thus destroying the wall). If either bracelet is taken off or a portion of the wall is breached or destroyed, this effect immediately ends and the wall of stone crumbles to dust.","26,760 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bracelets-of-stone
Cube of Frost Resistance,"This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.","27,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cube-of-frost-resistance
Helm of Telepathy,"This pale metal or ivory helm covers much of the head when worn. The wearer can use detect thoughts at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day, the wearer of the helm can implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) along with his telepathic message.","27,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-telepathy
Horseshoes of Mist,"When a horse is shod with these horseshoes, they give off a puff of mist each time a hoof strikes the earth. On the rider’s command, the mount and the rider are both affected as if subject to a gaseous form spell. If for some reason the rider and the mount become separated from one another while in gaseous form, the effect automatically ends for both. The horseshoes can be used for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.","27,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horseshoes-of-mist
Periapt of Proof against Poison,"This item is a brilliant-cut black gem on a delicate silver chain meant to be worn about the neck.

"Boots, Rime-Stride","These fur-lined boots grant the wearer the ability to glide easily across icy surfaces. While doing so, the wearer adds 15 feet to her speed, and she does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. While fighting on ice, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD. Once per day, the wearer may cause all surfaces within a 30-foot radius of himself to become covered in a thin sheet of ice for 10 rounds. A creature can walk within or through this icy area at half normal speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls. A creature using Acrobatics in this way is considered flat-footed and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC.","27,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/boots-rime-stride
"Bracers, Swallowtail","These delicate sliver bracers are decorated with blue butterflies. While worn, swallowtail bracers grant the wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. If the wearer worships the associated deity, the bracers grant an additional boon: Once per day, by speaking a command word and the name and/or title of the intended recipient, the wearer may cast dream. Such a wearer is also immune to nightmare, and when the wearer is targeted by that spell, the effects reflect back upon the caster.","27,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/swallowtail-bracers
Gloves of the Shortened Path,"Once per day on command, the wearer of these oxblood leather gloves can bend space to extend her reach to a non-adjacent square within line of sight. For the next 10 rounds, she can touch anything in that square as if it were her own square, as long as she has line of effect to the target square. She may change the targeted square as a swift action. When using the gloves to touch, attack, or manipulate anything in the square, the wearer’s arms and hands also appear in that square, allowing creatures and effects to target her as if she were in that square. She cannot use this connection to transfer anything from her square to the target square, or vice versa. If she drops anything, it lands in her square. She can use her hands (including natural attacks from those hands, if any), hand-held objects (such as lockpicks), and melee weapons in that square as if she were there. The square is part of her threatened area, though she cannot use the gloves to provide flanking for herself. She cannot use the gloves to grapple, make ranged attacks, or make attacks that require her to move out of her actual square (such as a bull rush combat maneuver). Interacting with the target square is distracting, and anything that threatens her in her actual square automatically flanks her. If the wearer or her square is blocked from using teleportation or planar travel effects (such as dimensional anchor), the gloves do not function. She cannot use the gloves to target a square protected by such an effect.","27,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/gloves-of-the-shortened-path
Hand of Stone,"This mummified dwarf hand hangs on a steel chain around a character’s neck, bringing the wearer more in tune with the earth beneath her feet. If the wearer spends a standard action concentrating on the hand, she gains tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet until the start of her next turn. This ability only allows her to sense creatures and objects that are in contact with earth or stone.","27,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hand-of-stone
Robe of Scintillating Colors,"The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect. Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment). Additionally, the robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously. The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.","27,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-scintillating-colors
Face of Dagon,"This peculiar idol, carved from some unknown green stone, depicts a seven-legged octopoid figure with a horribly grinning face. Also known as the Seasage Effigy, the Face of Dagon is a sacred relic of the ulat-kini. The bearer of the idol can breathe water (as the water breathing spell) as long as it is in her possession. In addition, the bearer can cast commune once per week to contact Dagon or one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods. Each time the Face of Dagon is used in this way, however, the bearer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer insanity (as the spell) as her mind is opened to the horrors of beyond.","27,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/face-of-dagon
Headband of Knucklebones,"This headband is made of interlocked finger bones woven together by leathery tendons and gristle.

"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Obsidian Steed","This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.","28,500 ",?,?,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/figurines-of-wondrous-power/obsidian-steed-figurine-of-wondrous-power
Book of Marvelous Recipes,"The pages of this thick and travel-worn leather book visibly rewrite themselves as a reader flips through them, creating a number of delicious recipes that seem to anticipate the current craving or culinary desires of the reader. The recipes can aid the reader in creating such dishes, allowing him to use the Profession (cook) skill untrained, or granting a +4 competence bonus on such checks if the reader is trained in that skill. Furthermore, once per day, this book can be used to enhance a meal the reader is cooking. When used in this way, it grants the meal being cooked the effects of a heroes' feast spell (caster level 11th).","28,800 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-of-marvelous-recipes
Navigator's Eye,"Unlike the heavy cast-brass mariner's astrolabes normally used at sea, this astrolabe is of the more common type found on land, made of flat discs of brass. A famed navigator was said to have sacrificed her eye to the instrument to grant her knowledge of things beyond mortal sight, thus giving the astrolabe its name. In addition to an astrolabe's normal +2 circumstance bonus, Navigator's Eye grants a further +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (geography), Profession (sailor), and Survival checks when used to navigate on land or sea. Once per day, the user can make a DC 20 Perception check while using Navigator's Eye as a move action to catch a glimpse of how things really are for 1 round, as if with a true seeing spell. While using the astrolabe's true seeing ability, the user can also see through concealment caused by smoke or fog and gains a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks to spot hidden or disguised creatures or objects.","28,800 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/navigator-s-eye
"Stone, Canopic","A canopic stone is a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver.  The stone permanently binds a spectral vilkacis to the Material Plane. So long as the stone exists, the creature remains stuck between life and death, its spirit strangling on its own rage. The bearer of a canopic stone can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone’s bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature’s body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act. Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.","28,800 ",12,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-canopic
Colossus Draught,"This potent elixir is capped with an incredibly tight lid; a successful DC 22 Strength check is needed to open and allow access to the bubbling jade liquid within. Once the vial is opened, the contents must be imbibed within the next minute, or they spoil and have no effect. Drinking the colossus draught imparts a temporary +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, and increases the imbiber's size to the next larger category (as enlarge person, with all the resulting bonuses and penalties) for the next 24 hours.

"Chest, Chest of Defending","This appears to be a complex wooden chest of immense size—at least 5 feet long and 3 feet wide and tall, with numerous drawers, side-compartments, hatches, and lids and ornately carved feet and scrollwork trim. In spite of its size, a chest of defending has an interior volume of 6 cubic feet. It has permanent alarm and arcane lock spells cast on it, which can be set to acknowledge a specific creature as the effective caster of the spells with a command word (thus allowing that creature to determine the details of the chest's spells as if she had cast them). This password is normally carved in one of the small drawers. All the compartments of the chest have average quality locks, and can be further locked with padlocks (not included). If the chest's alarm spell is triggered, the chest's most impressive magic property comes into effect: it alters shape and composition to become a Medium wood golem (the chest's contents are unharmed by the transformation). Unless given different instructions by someone who uses the chest's command word, the golem attacks the creature that triggered its alarm, then folds back into a normal chest once the trespasser is defeated. All the items within the chest count against the golem's encumbrance.","29,300 ",12,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chest-chest-of-defending
"Broom of Flying, Racing","A racing broom of flying functions like a broom of flying, except for 9 minutes per day it can fly faster than its standard counterpart. Activating this increased speed is a swift action. The broom's increased fly speed is 60 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 40 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. Each minute at this faster speed uses 1 hour of the broom's daily flight time. As a swift action, the rider may expend 5 hours of flight time to increase the broom's speed to 120 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 80 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. This speed boost lasts for 1 round, but when it ends there is a 50% chance that the broom gains the broken condition and is powerless until repaired.","30,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/broom-of-flying-racing
Dragon Herald Vestments,"A set of dragon herald vestments is covered in scales of one of five different colors, and grants resist energy 5 of one type (as the resist energy spell) to the wearer: acid for black or green, electricity for blue, fire for red, or cold for white. If the wearer is a kobold with scales matching one of those five colors, she can speak a command word in Draconic to change the vestments' scales to the same color as her own, or back to the color chosen when the vestments were constructed. Altering the scales' color is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.","30,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dragon-herald-vestments

That ally gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the start of the wearer’s next turn.

Once the boots are attuned to a location, once per day as a full-round action, the wearer, along with anything she is wearing or carrying, teleports back to the attuned location as the getaway spell, except that no allies are teleported when the boots are activated even if they were in the area when the boots were attuned to their location.

Cauldron of the Dead,"This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if animated by an animate dead spell. Each corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron can animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the undead so created—up to 12 HD, unless the user can cast the animate dead spell, in which case that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.","30,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cauldron-of-the-dead
"Chest, Chest of the Mercane","This beautiful, gem-encrusted golden chest measures 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet tall. The chest of the mercane is engraved with symbols of wealth and trade, and comes with an equally ornate key. Even without its magic properties, the chest is worth 5,000 gp. The chest is bonded to a traveling mercane that makes i ts living trading magical items throughout the planes. The chest acts as if affected by the secret chest spell (CL 9th), except it allows the key wielder to retrieve the chest once per day and send it back to its mercane master once per day. The chest's ornate key functions as the small replica chest does in secret chest. Each time the chest is sent back to its mercane master, there's a chance the mercane decides to buy any new magic item in the chest. If the mercane buys the item, it may pay slightly less than, equal to, or more than the standard market value (normally 50% of its total value). The mercane's interest and payment is determined by the table below. If the mercane does buy an item, the payment is always in gold pieces that take the item's place in the chest of the mercane. [  (d%) - (Mercane's Trade): ** 01–10 - 40% of the item's total value; ** 11–50 - Item is not purchased; ** 51–90 - 50% of the item's total value; ** 91–99 - 60% of the item's total value; ** 100 - 75% of item's total value  ] It's also possible to send notes to the mercane connected to the chest, but such notes never receive a response through the chest. If an owner of the chest of the mercane finds the mercane connected to it, she can use the ability to pass notes to pay in advance (with magic items) for objects she wishes the mercane to purchase on the owner's behalf. Such objects are never sent via the chest; the mercane requires that they be picked up in person.","30,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/chest-chest-of-the-mercane

If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial).

Eyes of Eyebite,"These glasses look like golden teeth holding a pair of green-tinted lenses. The wearer may use eyebite 11 times per day on command, affecting one target for each use of the spell. The wearer does not need to use these rounds consecutively, but each activation is a standard action (unlike the spell, in which targeting a new foe is a swift action).

Iron Circlet of Guarded Souls,"This simple cold iron circle has no markings or ornamentation upon it, and is always slightly cool to the touch. The circle shields both the wearer’s soul and his identity from mystic intrusion. The wearer is immune to effects that target souls (such as trap the soul) or that would be foiled by a nondetection spell (unlike nondetection, the diviner’s caster cannot attempt a spell resistance check to overcome this effect). If the wearer is slain, he cannot be restored to life by magic (save by a miracle, wish, or divine intervention) until the circlet is removed.","30,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/iron-circlet-of-guarded-souls

If the wearer has the wild shape class feature, the mask allows her to use wild shape to take the form of a humanoid with the giant subtype. The forms allowed by a lesser mask of giants are ogre, troll, fire giant, frost giant, or stone giant. If the form has any of the following abilities, the wearer gains the listed ability: darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent.

Captain's Locker,"This iron-banded sea chest is 2-1/2 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet in size and is decorated with chains and brass skulls. The chest has no lock, but any standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500 pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater. When a captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however, so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold. If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone standing within 5 feet of the means of egress..","30,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/captain-s-locker
"Eye, Soulbound","Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several long spikes. A soulbound eye is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear—they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A soulbound eye must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature’s brow—the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim’s forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the “master”). Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer’s senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. The soulbound eye’s wearer is not compelled to obey its master’s telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike, or suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell, no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound eye. An implanted soulbound eye functions like a cursed item once it is in place—it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like remove curse or break enchantment. Once removed, a soulbound eye crumbles to fragments.","30,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/eye-soulbound

Bag of Shadow Clouds,"Anyone peering into this bag of deep gray cloth sees nothing but empty blackness. Within the bag exists an extradimensional space linked to the Plane of Shadow. Three times per day, as a move action, the bearer can reach within the bag and pull out 1d4 semisolid shards of shadow. The bag's bearer can use each shard of shadow as a thrown weapon targeting a single 5-foot square. When it hits, it acts as a darkness spell, but only affecting one 5-foot square. As a move action, the bearer of the bag can move a shadow cloud up to 10 feet in any direction. Whether or not they are thrown, the shards of shadow and shadow clouds last 10 minutes before dissipating.","30,240 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-shadow-clouds
"Bracers, High Elven","These finely crafted leather bracers have plates of silvered steel covering the back, and silver buckles at the wrist and forearm. The bracers enable the wearer to use any traditional elven weapon (longbows, composite longbows, longswords, rapiers, shortbows, composite shortbows, and any weapon with the word “elven” in its name) as if he were proficient in its use. If he uses such a weapon and is already proficient with it, he gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Infernal Cord (Greater),"This item functions as an infernal cord, but it grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and the fast healing effect increases to fast healing 4. Treat the Constitution bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer can be detected as though she were an evil cleric, not just an evil creature.","31,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/infernal-cord
"Belt, Merform","Once per day, the wearer of this belt can command it to transform her into the form of a merfolk. While in this form, the wearer can breathe water and transform her lower body into a merfolk fishtail. Her new form provides a +2 natural armor bonus and a swim speed of 30 feet, though while the wearer is in this form her land speed is reduced to 5 feet. The wearer can take this form for up to 12 hours, and can end the effect at any time with a command.","32,000 ",3,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/belt-merform
Floating Sail (20ft x 50ft),"This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating sail unfurls up to its full size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second time, the floating sail folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker (this space must be one that the floating sail was touching while unfurled). If the floating sail is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses and takes the form of a normal silk sail; depending on whether the sail was placed on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing on it may become entangled in the sail, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly, a floating sail immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed floating sail must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated again.[  Capacity (lbs.) - 2000  ]","32,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/floating-sail
Scabbard of True Death,"Whenever an assassin draws a weapon from the scabbard of true death and makes a successful death attack against her target, the DC of her true death ability increases by 4. In addition, regardless of whether the wielder has levels in the assassin class, the wielder gains the bleeding attack rogue talent as though she had a sneak attack that dealt 1d6 points of damage (thus, attacks that qualify as sneak attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage); if the wielder already has the bleeding attack rogue talent, the bleed damage caused by that talent is increased by 1.","32,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/scabbard-of-true-death
"Shadow Piercings, Eye (Greater)","These piercings may penetrate the eyebrow, eyelid, or the eye itself. Due to magical, they do not impair the owner's vision.

"Headband, Winter Wolf","Crafted of pale bone or silver, this headband features a snarling wolf’s head centered on the wearer’s forehead. The wearer gains cold resistance 10. Once per day, the wearer may transform into a Large white-furred wolf for 11 minutes. In addition, once per day the wearer may breathe a 30-foot cone of cold that deals 7d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 16 for half). The wearer may use this breath weapon even when transformed.","32,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-winter-wolf
Runestone of Power (4th),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 4th level.","32,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1
Verdict of the Nether Courts,"Infused with the power of Hell’s courts, this blood-quenched steel gavel emits an ear-splitting din when struck against a hard surface. Once per day, as a standard action, you can use it to judge a single foe within 30 feet, who then suffers the effect of a dictum spell. The gavel bestows one negative level on any chaotic or good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. If the creature is chaotic good, these negative levels stack.","32,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/verdict-of-the-nether-court
Healer's Burning Glass,"The handle of this magnifying glass is shaped like a holy symbol. When used to treat deadly wounds, the glass provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. Once per day, it can be used to affect a touched creature with regenerate (as the spell). The user must be in an area of bright light to use either function.","32,400 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/healer-s-burning-glass
"Cape, Highwayman’s","This reversible multicolored cape marks the wearer’s flamboyant audacity when turned with its bright colors outward, granting a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks. Reversible as a move action, the dappled camouflage of its other side grants a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Regardless of the cape’s current facing, the wearer can spend an immediate action at will to roll an Escape Artist check against being grappled, bound, or restrained as if the cape targeted her with liberating command.”","32,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cape-highwayman-s
Cauldron of Resurrection,"The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if from a raise dead or resurrection spell. The spell effect depends on the components used: raise dead costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while resurrection costs 10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron can function once per day.","33,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cauldron-of-resurrection
"Shadow Piercings, Head (Greater)","Whether they are crowns of pins, pinned-back lips, or simple nose rings, these piercings accentuate the owner's terrifying presence and inner resolve.

"Cap, Steel-Mind","Ruined scraps of various constructs were repurposed and combined to form this ornate iron helmet. Though the helmet is not intelligent, it has a brute mechanical cunning that allows it to assert control whenever the wearer’s mind is overwhelmed. The helmet takes control of the wearer’s body anytime he is dazed or stunned. Whenever the wearer would be dazed, he is instead confused. Whenever the wearer would be stunned, he is instead confused and staggered. Time spent under the cap’s influence counts against the duration of the daze or stun effect. The cap functions for up to 5 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The cap stops asserting control over its wearer when the duration of the daze or stun effect ends, or when the cap’s 5 rounds of duration are expended.","33,600 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cap-steel-mind
Masters' Call,"Platinum filigree wraps around this small, spiral-shell amulet, which hangs on an ornate chain that resembles entwined tentacles. Enchantment spells and effects created by the wearer of a masters' call are treated as though they came from an aboleth source, so gillman targets take their racial –2 penalty on Will saves to resist the amulet's effects. Once per day, the wearer can speak a trigger phrase in the Aboleth language to cast dominate person on a single target (Will DC 18 negates). Regardless of whether the dominate person spell succeeds, the wearer can then attempt to cast modify memory on the same target to change its memory of either the actions the target performed while dominated or the attempted domination (Will DC 17 negates).","34,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/masters-call
Dirgesinger's Choir,"Equal parts grisly and lovely, this unusual harp-like musical instrument is crafted from a corpse, with a bone frame, skin stretched around the soundbox for percussion, and strings of twisted hair. When played, it can summon forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument. If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as control undead cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends. Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via raise dead. As long as the instrument exists, resurrection and true resurrection can revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument. The instrument cannot be affected by spells that target corpses, such as animate dead or decompose corpse.","34,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dirgesinger-s-choir

Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location,"This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the wearer had cast nondetection on herself ).","35,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location
Carpet of Flying (5x10),"This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell of unlimited duration. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions. A carpet of flying can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. a carpet of flying can hover without making a Fly skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other Fly checks. Measuring 5 ft by 10 ft, its capacity is 400 lbs and speed is 40 ft.","35,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/carpet-of-flying
Cloak of Disarming,"This cloak is well crafted and stylish. As a swift action, the wearer can direct the cloak to attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a creature within 5 feet, using the wearer's CMB. This disarm combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the wearer doesn't risk losing the cloak. The wearer can spend 1 panache point before making the disarm attempt to gain a +5 competence bonus on the combat maneuver check.","35,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-disarming
Lucky Rock,"[  Alignment - neutral good; Senses - 120 ft.; Intelligence - 10; Wisdom - 16; Charisma - 14; Ego - 10; Communication - Speech (Common, Halfling)  ] This stone of good luck is weathered and resembles nothing so much as a hard piece of shale. The stone can cast good hope once per day, and its bearer gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against fear effects and effects with the emotion descriptor. The stone is very chatty, making friendly observations about its bearer and offering unsolicited advice about the bearer's current situation. The stone speaks with a slight drawl and uses simple words, but its advice is usually quite sound. Around obvious followers of evil gods, the stone is instead silent and shudders slightly.","35,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lucky-rock
Witching Gown,"Spun from combed cotton, this simple, unassuming gown bears a strong aura of witchcraft. These magical garments are highly sought after by witches, for though anyone may wear a witching gown, only a witch may realize its full potential. A witching gown grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +2 competence bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. When worn by a witch, these bonuses double. In addition, a witch may change the appearance and style of the gown to match her whims (as the glamered armor special ability) and adopt virtually any disguise, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks that incorporate the gown’s appearance. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic can pierce this effect. Lastly, a witch may cast a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower into the gown. Thereafter, the gown holds the magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to strike the witch with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver. The gown’s spite spell counts as an active spite effect for the witch wearing the gown.","35,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/witching-gown
"Book, Golem Manual (Iron)","A golem manual contains information, incantations, and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.","35,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-golem-manual
"Helm, Stormlord’s","Two large horns jut from the sides of this iron helm, each of them carved with runes representing storms, thunder, and lightning. The runes give the wearer the ability to control the elements and bring forth a great storm. Once per day, the wearer can call upon the magic of the helm to call a thunderstorm, as if casting the control weather spell. Like that spell, it takes 10 minutes to call the weather and an additional 10 minutes for the thunderstorm to manifest. Once it does, the wearer can call lighting (as the spell) for 10 minutes or until the wearer dismisses the thunderstorm with a standard action.","35,000 ",10,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-stormlord-s
"Manacles, Thorned","When placed on a helpless, two-armed creature of size Tiny to Huge, these barbed manacles transform to match the creature's size and prevent the captive from utilizing any extradimensional magic, as dimensional anchor (no save). Removing the manacles—whether as an escape attempt or by the owner— requires a successful DC 30 Strength check or a successful DC 37 Escape Artist check; regardless of whether such an attempt succeeds, the manacles deal 2d6+7 points of piercing damage to the victim. The manacles have hardness 12 and 20 hit points.","35,600 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/manacles-thorned
Necrograft (Strangler's Tongue),"Extracted from a mohrg, this ropy, claw-tipped tongue is implanted into a recipient's mouth or throat. A strangler's tongue lacks the strength to grasp or hold items, but the host can lash out with the tongue as a standard action as a melee touch attack. A humanoid hit by the strangler's tongue is paralyzed for 1d4 minutes (Will DC 15 negates).","36,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necrograft
Helm of Brilliance (Lesser),"This helm functions like a helm of brilliance but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm’s allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (fireball, 10d6 damage, DC 20 Reflex half), 20 corals (flaming sphere), 30 garnets (scorching ray), and 40 agates (light). It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30). Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer’s space, garnets become scorching rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and helm are destroyed.","36,000 ",5,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-brilliance-lesser
Orb of Utter Chaos,"This globe of varicolored material constantly shifts hue and texture, from steel-hard to spongy or even gelatinous. The bearer of the orb is constantly protected by entropic shield. Three times per day, when the bearer holds the orb and casts a spell with the polymorph subtype, chaotic descriptor, or one that gives creatures the confused condition, she may modify her caster level for that spell by 1d6—2. Once per day the bearer may hold the orb and command it to dispel magic. If the dispel check succeeds, the wielder absorbs the unraveled magical energy through the orb and gains the benefit of an aid spell. The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb.","36,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-utter-chaos
"Bead, Boro (6th)","This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any one 6th level extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. A bead works on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or non-magical alchemical material such as antitoxin.","36,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bead-boro
"Crux, Marionette","Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim’s wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain. In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person. The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux’s wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack—passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user’s hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time—if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately. A marionette crux can be activated up to two times per day.","36,000 ",9,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crux-marionette

If the wearer is a gunslinger or has the Amateur Gunslinger feat, she begins each day with 1 additional grit point. This extra point does not increase her maximum grit total. When the wearer uses the gunslinger’s dodge deed, the deed’s dodge bonuses to AC increase by +1.

Page of Spell Knowledge (6th),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 6th level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","36,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (6th),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 6th level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day.

Spell Lattice (6th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","36,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
Harp of Slumber,"Despite having the strength and texture of unhewn stone, this pale white harp is sculpted from solid glass. A harp of slumber has several effects when played. At will, the user can produce a lullaby effect by plucking a single string. Up to three times per day, the user can strum the harp to produce a sleep effect. If the performer succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) skill check, this use of the harp functions as deep slumber instead. The DC for these effects increases by 2 against creatures with the giant subtype. Mythic: A mythic performer can expend one use of mythic power when strumming a harp of slumber in order to augment the effect it creates to mythic sleep, or mythic deep slumber if the performer also succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) check.","37,500 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/harp-of-slumber
Scarab of Protection,"This device appears to be a jade medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device. The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20.

"Wayfinder, Truthseeker","This wayfinder is crafted from polished gold and when viewed in bright light is highly reflective— resembling a mirror more than it does simple metal. A truthseeker wayfinder allows the wielder to cast zone of truth for up to 7 minutes per day (Will DC 14 negates). This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. If a creature saves against this effect once, it is immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saves are granted a new save each time the effect is activated anew. Once per day, the wielder of a truthseeker wayfinder can gain the benefits of discern lies for up to 7 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). When the truthseeker wayfinder senses the target creature issue an intentional falsehood, it vibrates just enough to be perceptible to the wielder but no one else.","39,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-truthseeker
Horseshoes of Glory,"These massive horseshoes sport deadly spikes that jut from their front. Once per day on command, the rider of a mount wearing these shoes may choose to either increase the mount’s size by one size increment (maximum Huge), or change its type to magical beast, as beast shape IV. In addition, while the mount is augmented in either of these two ways, it gains DR/5 chaos, evil, good, or law (selected by the rider). These horseshoes are part of a set and require all four to be worn by the same animal to properly function.","39,600 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horseshoes-of-glory
Dawn's Light,"When lit, this hooded lantern shines brightly in a 60-foot radius, as daylight. Once per day as a swift action, if the owner is a good-aligned divine spellcaster, she can intensify the lantern's light for 1 hour. This intensified light dazzles evil outsiders and undead in the area, and evil incorporeal creatures take 75% damage from magical attacks instead of 50%. If an illuminated creature or object has a mark indicating evil allegiance—such as a demoniac's demonic mark—that mark glow brilliantly, shining through anything short of magical concealments.","40,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dawn-s-light
Enmity Fetish,"This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).","40,000 ",5,Faint,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/enmity-fetish

Cauldron of Flying,"This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids to stand in comfortably. Upon command, the cauldron and up to 500 pounds of additional weight can fly as if using overland flight. The cauldron moves under the direction of the person who spoke the activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the need for a Fly skill check.

"Key, Moribund","Each moribund key bears an engraved skull with two gray, burned-out ioun stones for eyes. Small openings line the coin’s outer edge. By turning the skull’s head, an inner plate marked with runic symbols lines up with these openings to establish different combinations. Each setting matches symbols inscribed on objects of great importance to the cult, such as statues, paintings, and doors. The proper arrangement of these runes activates stored spell effects in such objects, including powerful wards, programmed images, or the release of arcane locks. The bearer of a moribund key can cast message at will, and spectral hand and vampiric touch 3 times per day. In addition, the skull’s eyes glow when undead approach within 60 feet. A moribund key bestows one negative level on any good creature carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the medallion is carried and cannot be overcome in any way while the medallion is in that creature’s possession.","40,000 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/key-moribund
Ring Gates,"These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has an “entry side” and an “exit side,” both marked with appropriate symbols.","40,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/ring-gates
Lantern of Dancing Shadows,"This small lantern is made of thin, nearly transparent paper and black iron. The lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. The lantern's light causes the illumination level in a 30-foot radius to move one step toward dim light, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from darkness to dim light. The lantern has no effect in an area that is already in dim light. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in the lantern's area. Magical light or darkness only change the light level in the lantern's area if they have a higher caster level than the lantern. Once per day, the lit lantern of dancing shadows can be commanded to create quasi-real illusions from the shadows cast by its light, as the shadow conjuration spell. In addition, once per day, the lantern can be commanded to solidify shadows for a short period of time. These solidified shadows cause incorporeal creatures within the lantern's illumination radius (30 feet) to coalesce into semi-physical forms, as the mass ghostbane dirge spell.","41,000 ",6,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/lantern-of-dancing-shadows

"Chest, Blood Chest","A blood chest is a medium-sized chest of red iron with a volume of 4 cubic feet. The metal sculpture of a monstrous fanged face surrounds the inset superior quality lock, making it impossible to reach the lock without putting a hand in the mouth. The chest is additionally sealed by a permanent arcane lock, and is protected by powerful magic that makes the chest as resilient as a wall of force. The chest is attuned to a particular owner, which can be changed by speaking a command word while the chest is open. Any key can be used in the lock, but whenever a key is inserted, the fanged mouth closes on the hand holding it (or on the device holding it, if some contraption is used to insert the key) and deals 1 point of damage. If the bitten hand is that of the owner attuned to the chest, the chest opens. If the hand belongs to anyone else, or no hand is present to bite, or the hand is not damaged by the bite, the chest doesn't open.

While wearing a necklace of netted stars, the wearer can create dancing lights at will and wandering star motes once per day. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a pearl of power. Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell using dispel magic, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace’s jewels for that day.","42,000 ",12,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necklace-of-netted-stars

Page of Spell Knowledge (7th),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 7th level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","49,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (7th),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 7th level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.","49,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power
Spell Lattice (7th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","49,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
Cloak of Displacement (Major),"Embroidered with images of falling stars and pale moons, this item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works just like the displacement spell and lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up as she sees fit.","50,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-displacement
Crystal Ball (w/ See Invisibility),"This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. a character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). a crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

Hobgoblin Battle Standard (Despair),"A battle standard is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects. A battle standard may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Despair: Enemies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of despair are sickened while within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become dazed for 1 round.","50,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hobgoblin-battle-standard
Horn of Valhalla,"This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be a normal, scarred old horn used for hunting or signaling during battle. When someone speaks its command word and blows the horn, however, the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned. [  (d%) - (Type of Horn) - (Barbarians Summoned) - (Prerequisite); 01–40 - Silver - 2d4+2 (2nd-level) - None; 41–75 - Brass - 2d4+1 (3rd-level) - Spellcaster level 1st; 76–90 - Bronze - 2d4 (4th-level) - Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability; 91–100 - Iron - 1d4+1 (5th-level) - Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability  ] Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.","50,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/horn-of-valhalla
Mantis Embrace,"These stylized red gloves are often employed for stealthy assassinations. If the wearer successfully pins an opponent with a grapple combat maneuver, she can perform a special coup de grace attack the next round with the gloves, treating them as if they were sawtooth sabres (1d8 slashing damage, critical threat range of 19–20) for the purposes of this attack. Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack, the target's head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells that require an intact body. A creature that survives this coup de grace attack is immune to subsequent attempts from any mantis embrace for 24 hours.","50,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mantis-embrace
Mantle of Immortality,"This elegant cape, trimmed in gold in a pattern resembling an ancient maze, forestalls the negative effects of aging. The wearer no longer suffers penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or older. The penalties return if the robe is removed (or its powers suppressed), and the sudden weight of years is so traumatic that the wearer must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be exhausted for 24 hours. Donning the robe again removes the age penalties, but does not remove this exhaustion, which must pass on its own or be remedied with magic.","50,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mantle-of-immortality
"Robe, Summoner's","A summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color as the endless sky of the Astral Plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends. As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in elemental body III; if it's a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in plant shape II; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in undead anatomy IIIUM. If the creature is of any other creature type, the wearer gains the abilities it possesses listed in beast shape IV.","50,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-summoner-s
Runestone of Power (5th),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 5th level.","50,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1
"Talisman, Melancholic","This sickly yellow devils talisman summons a hellmouth that connects to the Hellish layers of Dis and Malebolge. Once per day you can open a 10-foot portal to either of these layers. This portal remains open for 10 minutes (or until you dismiss it) and functions as the spell gate. The hellmouth summoned by this talisman is an amphisbaenic being known as Alksomasic, each of its two portal-heads appearing as a massive snake with three gigantic fly-like eyes. His maws connect to a shadowy alley in the city of Dis known as the Walk of Wayward Skins and to an outlying bolgia of Malebolge where monstrous worms slither through a waist-deep sea of ash.","50,000 ",8,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talisman-melancholic

Last Leaves of the Autumn Dryad,"This vibrant cluster of leaves constantly changes hue through the different colors of the autumn season, from brown and red to orange and yellow. Once per day, the bearer may touch the leaves to her tongue to assume tree shape (as the spell) for up to 8 hours, appearing as a healthy tree that is lush with thousands of autumn leaves for the duration of the effect. While in tree form, a creature may release these leaves upon the wind, consciously controlling them as a scrying sensor with the abilities of arcane eye. The leaves have the statistics of an army ant swarm, except the swarm has plant traits, fast healing 5, and vulnerability to fire. The creature may shape the scrying leaves into a semblance of her face, allowing her to speak through the leaves. The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer with the fey bloodline, she may have any ghost sound, speak with animals, or speak with plants spell she casts originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her tree shape does not prevent her from casting these spells. If the scrying leaves fail to return before creature returns to its normal shape, the magic item does not function for 1 week. During this time, the leaves fade to brown and appear to have a light coating of frost on them.","52,000 ",8,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/last-leaves-of-the-autumn-dryad
Astrologer's Telescope,"This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached to it. An astrologer's telescope functions as a telescope with ×50 magnification. A skilled astronomer can use an astrologer's telescope to glean insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so, the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead, albeit at a –5 penalty. If the viewing is successful, the user records that check result. Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's various apparatuses and taking a cumulative –5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography) or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight. On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography). Each additional viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope. A character can benefit from only one viewing at a time; a second viewing removes the previous benefit, regardless of whether the new attempt succeeds or fails.","54,000 ",110,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/astrologer-s-telescope

Wings of Flying,"A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability), also granting a +5 competence bonus on Fly skill checks.","54,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wings-of-flying
Cloak of Moral Refraction,"The cloak of moral refraction has long been a tool of mystics who charge themselves with maintaining cosmic balance and closing extraplanar portals throughout the multiverse. The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light nearly as well as a mirror. A fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges— charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn. The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following effects. [  ** 1 charge: Dispel an ongoing spell with an alignment descriptor, as the third function of dispel chaos/evil/ good/law.; ** 2 charges: Ready an action to counter a spell or spell-like ability with an alignment descriptor. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. The charges are expended only after countering a spell or spell-like ability. If you ready this action but it is not triggered, the charges are not expended.; ** 3 charges: As an immediate action, counter a spell or spell-like ability cast by an outsider with an alignment subtype.  ] The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. In addition, the outsider must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be banished back to its home plane, as banishment. An outsider with more than 26 Hit Dice is unaffected by the banishment effect.","54,200 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-moral-refraction
Cloak of Etherealness,"This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell).

This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.","55,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-of-etherealness
Instant Fortress,"This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even knock spells can't open the door. The adamantine walls of an instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken. The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half). The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.","55,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/instant-fortress
"Banner, Lord's (Terror)","A lord's banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Terror: Enemies of the bearer of a lord's banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner.

Cube of Varied Force Walls,"This cube functions exactly like a cube of force except that each wall of the cube can be activated independently and can even have different effects. For example, one wall can block living matter, another wall can block magic, and a third can keep out gases, while the other sides are open without any protection. Activating each wall costs the price of activating that effect for an entire standard cube of force — for instance, one wall against magic and one wall against living matter cost a total of 7 charges per minute.","56,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cube-of-varied-force-walls

Rust Monster Antenna Whip,"Crafted from a preserved rust monster antenna, this item works similarly to a gauntlet of rust, with the exceptions that you can make a rusting grasp touch attack with the whip at will, you can use it on all non-magical metallic objects (not just ferrous ones), and it does not protect you from other rusting attacks.

"Wayfinder, Headhunter","The forms of numerous animals, magical beasts, and other famous creatures appear in relief on every inch of this iron wayfinder's surface, creating a maze of lions, hawks, dragons, and elephants. Though a headhunter wayfinder looks like a normal compass, it doesn't point toward true north as one would expect. Rather, if a piece of hair, a drop of blood, or some other organic matter from an individual creature is placed in the socket normally reserved for an ioun stone, the wayfinder's needle points out this creature as though it were the subject of a locate creature spell with a radius of 680 feet from the wayfinder's wielder. This effect has no set duration, and functions as long as a specimen of the target creature is held within the wayfinder and the creature is within range. If the target creature isn't in range, the headhunter wayfinder's needle slowly spins clockwise. As with the locate creature spell, running water and spells such as mislead, nondetection, and polymorph fool or otherwise block the effect. A headhunter wayfinder can't hold an ioun stone and doesn't provide resonant powers.","56,000 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-headhunter
Wayfinder of Many Paths,"This wayfinder has a spiral of stars at the center of its compass, and its housing is decorated with images of doors. A wayfinder of many paths behaves like a normal wayfinder, allowing it to shine (as the light spell) on command and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid getting lost. It has a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone, and when an ioun stone is placed within, the owner of the wayfinder gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head. Once per day on command, a wayfinder of many paths with an implanted ioun stone can be used to create a 5- to 20-foot-diameter gateway, similar to the spell gate. The exact destination depends on the type of ioun stone slotted into the wayfinder; ioun stones of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds. If fitted with an ioun stone while in that stone's attuned location, a wayfinder of many paths can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used, allowing its user to make a return trip after 24 hours.","57,750 ",18,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-of-many-paths

Once he has done so, the wearer can also return to his plane of origin on command, also as per the plane shift spell. This robe also grants its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Finally, the wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken. The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons.

Carpet of Flying (10x10),"This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell of unlimited duration. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions. A carpet of flying can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. a carpet of flying can hover without making a Fly skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other Fly checks.

Deadlimb Pins,"As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inch-long pins into their paired vial to coat them in the viscous blue-black liquid within. This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved. A creature may be affected by multiple instances of deadlimb pins. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion. In order to function, deadlimb pins must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of deadlimb pins and their adjoining vial can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted.","60,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/deadlimb-pins
Hobgoblin Battle Standard (Ferocity),"A battle standard is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects. A battle standard may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Ferocity: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of ferocity gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the banner.","60,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hobgoblin-battle-standard
Orb of Pure Law,"This featureless gray stone is perfectly smooth and flawlessly polished. The bearer of an orb of pure law gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from chaotic creatures and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against polymorph effects, effects with the chaotic descriptor, and effects that inflict the confused condition. When held in hand, the bearer of the orb may use detect chaos and detect law at will. A lawful creature may hold the orb in hand and command it to invoke dispel chaos and arrow of law each once per day. The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any chaotic creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb.","60,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/orb-of-pure-law
Thunder Strap,"This sturdy leather strap seems worn and weathered, but is as strong as steel. When wrapped around the grip of a melee weapon for 24 hours, the strap's magic becomes active. Once per day, the wielder of a melee weapon so wrapped can hold the weapon aloft for 1 minute to change local weather conditions to create a thunderstorm. This acts as control weather, except only thunderstorms can be created. Additionally, the wielder can cast call lightning storm once per day. If used outside, this spell is cast as if the local conditions are stormy.","60,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/thunder-strap
Well of Stars,"Rather than opening to locations on different planes, this well instead opens to worlds on the Material Plane. It does not, however, necessarily open to worlds with similar environments to that of its user; hence it can pose much the same danger as the traditional well in terms of both the unpredictable environs of the destination and the alien beings that might step through from the other side.","60,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/well-of-stars
Cube of Force,"This device is just under an inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged—charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table. When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below. Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells cannot be cast into or out of the cube. [  (Cube Face) - (Charge Cost per Minute) - (Max. Speed) - (Effect): 1 - 1 - 30 ft. - Keeps out gases, wind, etc.; 2 - 2 - 20 ft. - Keeps out nonliving matter; 3 - 3 - 15 ft. - Keeps out living matter; 4 - 4 - 10 ft. - Keeps out magic; 5 - 6 - 10 ft. - Keeps out all things; 6 - 0 - As normal - Deactivates  ][  (Attack Form) - (Extra Charges): Disintegrate - 6; Horn of blasting - 6; Passwall - 3; Phase door - 5; Prismatic spray - 7; Wall of fire - 2  ]","62,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cube-of-force
Headband of Mental Resilience,"Five faceted sapphires decorate this ornate headband. The headband protects the wearer from effects that would damage his mental capacity. After wearing the headband for 24 hours, the wearer gains five temporary ability points. These points do not add to the wearer’s ability scores and do not grant a bonus to any roll. Any damage or drain to a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) taken by the wearer is subtracted from these points first. Damage or drain in excess of the wearer’s temporary ability points is applied to his current ability scores as normal. The wearer immediately loses all temporary ability points upon removing the headband. In addition, the headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence +2. Temporary ability points that are lost to ability damage return after 24 hours. Ability points lost to ability drain are lost permanently.","64,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/headband-of-mental-resilience
Page of Spell Knowledge (8th),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 8th level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","64,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (8th),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 8th level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.","64,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power
Robe of Gates,"Silver circles and conjuring runes decorate this black robe. Three times per day when the wearer uses a summoning spell or spell-like ability to summon a variable number of creatures, he can choose to summon the maximum number of creatures possible. Creatures summoned in this way step from the shadowy folds of the robe, and appear adjacent to the wearer. If there isn’t sufficient room for all the creatures to appear, the extra creatures are wasted and do not appear. If the wearer is a summoner, he can call upon the robe to summon his eidolon as a standard action once per day. It must appear adjacent to the summoner when called this way.","64,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-gates
Spell Lattice (8th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","64,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
Robes of Lead,"The eldest ayngavhaul garb themselves in robes of lead, massive suits of armor imbued with diabolical runes and profane symbols. These hulking, blasphemous vestments do little to impede the corpulent fiends’ already encumbered movement, yet grant them significant defense against servants of the divine. An ayngavhaul wearing robes of lead gains a +6 armor bonus and a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class.  In addition, these robes add +10 to the wearer’s SR when attempting to resist spells cast by a good-aligned divine spellcaster. Any Huge creature can wear robes of lead, but non-ayngavhauls must contend with their crushing, 900-pound weight. Any non-evil creature that attempts to wear robes of lead gains one negative level until the vestments are removed.

"Cubes of Force, Twinned","These cubes function as two cubes of force, except that when a face on one cube is pressed, its counterpart creates the appropriate wall instead as long as the distance between the cubes does not exceed 100 feet.

Monocle of the Investigator,"This crystal lens fits over a single eye but takes up the entire eyes slot. Once per day, the wearer is able to gaze at a 10-foot-by-10-foot area and see exactly what occurred in that area during the past 24 hours. The vision of what occurred in the specified area comes to the user in a single minute of observation; if that minute is interrupted, the wearer must use the monocle again to get the full observation. All the visual details of the observed events are clear and memorable to the user, no matter how obscure. The monocle does not, however, provide any insight into the observed events besides what can be visually seen. Observed conversations cannot be heard, for example.","66,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/monocle-of-the-investigator

"Kimono, Otherwordly","Embroidered images of cherry blossoms and cranes in flight adorn this blue silk kimono. The wearer can move and reposition these images on the kimono at will. The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks. Once per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a maze spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with 'walls' of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn’t escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Whenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim’s image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono’s other images. While a victim is trapped inside, the kimono’s bonuses on saving throws and caster level checks are increased by 2 (to +6). The kimono’s increased bonuses return to normal when the victim is freed or released.","67,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/kimono-other
Talons of Leng,"Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked talons. Once donned, the talons of Leng grant the wearer a natural claw attack with each hand that deal 1d4 points of damage for a Medium wearer, or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer. These claw attacks have a +3 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become permanently confused as per the insanity spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. The wearer of the talons of Leng is immune to effects that grant the confused condition. For as long as she wears the talons, however, her Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices constantly whisper through her head. The talons of Leng do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or wielding weapons.","67,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/talons-of-leng

Once per day, you can make an opposed Charisma check against the barbazu’s +0 modifier to summon him forth for 8 rounds, as per the spell summon monster. The barbazu bound within this sanguine talisman is known as Kalvaddas the Strangler. He is a blunt sadist with a love of hand-to-hand brawls and strangling elves.

"Ioun Stone, Sepia Ellipsoid","This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.","68,000 ",18,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones/sepia-ellipsoid-ioun-stone

Wayfinder of the Sleeping Eye,"This exquisitely crafted wayfinder bears the design of a half-closed eye in platinum and mithral. The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled, you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory image of yourself that is partly real. You control the image as if it were your own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points, which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage. Using this ability drains energy from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless for 24 hours. A dull gray ioun stone cannot power the projection ability of this wayfinder. The wayfinder can still have synergistic powers granted by an ioun stone, though they do not function while the slotted stone is powerless.","70,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-of-the-sleeping-eye
Wayfinder of The Stars,"About half again the size of a standard wayfinder, a wayfinder of the stars features an extra outer ring around the normal directional compass in the center. Embedded into this outer ring are 13 semi-precious stones, each representing a major celestial body of the solar system. At will, the owner can speak the item's command word to cause the wayfinder's compass needle to stop pointing north and instead indicate the direction of the nearest active interplanetary portal within 500 miles. If no such portal is within range, the compass needle hangs listlessly. A second command word causes the wayfinder of the stars to once again function as a basic wayfinder. Once per day, the owner can touch one of the semi-precious stones on the wayfinder of the stars to teleport her and any willing creatures touching her to a safe location on the indicated planet, as interplanetary teleport.","70,200 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-of-the-stars
Wings of the Gargoyle,"These cloth shoulder straps have many pebbles stitched into them. The wearer of the straps can command them to unfurl a pair of wings made from a hard gray stone. These wings grant her a fly speed of 60 feet and average maneuverability. When these wings are present her skin also takes on a noticeable stone-like appearance and she gains DR 10/adamantine.

Runestone of Power (6th),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours.

"Sash, Scaled","Glittering with every movement, this sash is associated with a specific type of chromatic dragon. Three times per day, the wearer may convert all the damage dealt by a single attack with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon into the matching dragon's breath weapon damage type. The amount of damage dealt remains unaffected. The sash may be used after the attack's results are known, but must be declared before damage has been rolled. Attacks dealing any type of energy damage cannot be converted in this manner unless the energy type of the original damage is the same as that granted by the scaled sash. If the original attack would be affected by damage reduction, the converted damage is reduced as if it did not bypass the damage reduction, even if the target has no special defenses against the converted energy type For example, an archer wearing a black scaled sash makes a successful attack against a target with his longbow. Before rolling damage on the hit, he opts to use his sash to convert the damage dealt to acid damage. Damage is rolled normally, but deals acid damage instead of piercing damage. This includes damage dealt from additional effects such as sneak attack, favored enemy, and the bane special weapon property.","73,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/sash-scaled

"Banner, Lord's (Victory)","A lord's banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Victory: Allies of the owner of a lord's banner of victory gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.","75,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-lord-s
Gem of Seeing,"This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell.

Robe of the Archmagi,"This normal-appearing garment is attuned to one of three types of alignment. It can be white (01—45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46—75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76—100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer’s alignment doesn’t match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item’s powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows: +5 armor bonus to AC; Spell resistance 18; +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws; +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three permanent negative levels. The same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including through restoration spells).

When worn by a bard, the robe grants the wearer the following powers: Spell resistance 18; +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws; +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. Bards and those who fancy themselves actors or performers commission versions of these robes using only the finest fabric.","75,000 ",16,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-of-the-resplendent-thespian

"Cloak, Wyvern","This heavy cloak is made of blue scaled leather and has a pointed hem that hangs near the ground. The cloak provides the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on Will saves, a continuous feather fall effect (as the spell), and the ability to use fly once per day. At will as a swift action, the wearer can form the hem into a stinger, granting her a sting natural weapon. This sting deals 1d6 points of damage plus poison (as the spell; DC 16). Reverting the stinger to its normal, inconspicuous shape is a free action.","78,600 ",7,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cloak-wyvern
"Blindfold, Swordmaster’s","This black band of silk grants its wearer spectacular senses within a limited range. Some believe these items were made to grant lesser swordmasters the illusion of skill. When the wearer places the blindfold over her eyes, she becomes blinded, but gains blindsight within the reach of her melee weapon, or 5 feet if the wearer is not wielding a melee weapon. Furthermore, the wearer is under the effect of a constant locate weakness spell, but only when making melee attacks.","80,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/blindfold-swordmaster-s
Crystal Ball (w/ True Seeing),"This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. a character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). a crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.","80,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crystal-ball
Helm of Reclamation,"The helm of reclamation is designed to destroy large groups of undead or powerful individual undead creatures, and is often used by undead-hating clerics with a flair for the dramatic. The gems of this helm produce sunburst (10 yellow diamonds), searing light (30 bloodstones), and daylight (40 opals). Like a standard helm of brilliance, it glows near and harms undead, and has the flaming weapon ability, but does not protect against fire or risk detonation.","80,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-reclamation
Page of Spell Knowledge (9th),"This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single 9th level arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a 4th-level spell.","81,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/page-of-spell-knowledge
Pearl of Power (9th),"This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one 9th level spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.","81,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power
Spell Lattice (9th),"A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells currently prepared. A spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell from the spell lattice.","81,000 ",17,Varied,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spell-lattice
Well of Many Worlds,"This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable hole. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily—it is a two-way portal.","82,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/well-of-many-worlds
"Well, Shadow","Rather than opening to random locations across the planes, the shadow well opens only to random locations on the Shadow Plane (or random locations on the Material Plane when on the Shadow Plane). Regardless of which plane the user opens the well from, there is a 15% chance it randomly diverts the user into the Ethereal Plane, given its nature as a natural buffer between the two realities.","82,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/well-shadow
Circlet of Petty Discord,"Once per day, when the wearer of this delicate silver crown casts a spell from the charm subschool, he can add a subtle compulsion to the effect. All targets affected by the spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become incredibly frustrated with their allies. For the next 10 rounds, affected targets still recognize their allies (and do not attack them), but they cannot treat them as allies when determining movement or flanking, nor can they use any feats (including teamwork feats), spells, abilities, or effects that allow them to target allies or use allies to gain beneficial effects, nor can they be the targets of such friendly effects. Affected targets also cannot aid another.","84,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/circlet-of-petty-discord
Halo of Menace,"When placed over the head, this halo of shimmering polished steel floats above it, though it still takes up the head slot. The halo constantly radiates a 20-foot-radius aura from its wearer. Any hostile creature within the aura must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and AC for the next 24 hours or until it hits the wearer with an attack or damages it with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. Chaotic creatures take a –2 penalty on this saving throw. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect of the halo of menace cannot be affected by the same wearer's aura for 24 hours. The aura is a mind-affecting effect.","84,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/halo-of-menace
Preyfinder,"These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though preyfinders function as standard compasses, making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures. To use a preyfinder, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the preyfinder's tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the preyfinder can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the preyfinder's magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the preyfinder telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the preyfinder's quarry. After a creature is marked as the preyfinder's quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the preyfinder provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells and effects. A preyfinder can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the preyfinder. When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a preyfinder grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the preyfinder's quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder, none of the preyfinder's magical powers functions for 24 hours.","85,000 ",9,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/preyfinder
Bowl of Conjuring Water Elementals,"This large container is usually fashioned from silver with a rippled pattern. It is about 1 foot in diameter and half that deep. The bowl must be filled with fresh or salt water to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon a water elemental. If the bowl is filled with salt water, it conjures a Huge water elemental as if using summon monster VI. If filled with fresh water, it conjures a Large water elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental empties the bowl. The bowl cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.","90,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bowl-of-conjuring-water-elementals
Brazier of Conjuring Fire Elementals,"This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. The brazier must be filled with coals or wood and a fire lit within it to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon a fire elemental. If 1 pound of brimstone (sulfur) is burning in the brazier, it conjures a Huge fire elemental as if using summon monster VI. Otherwise, the brazier conjures a Large fire elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental extinguishes the fire in the brazier. The brazier cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.","90,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/brazier-of-conjuring-fire-elementals
Carpet of Comfort,"This specialized carpet of flying always measures 10 feet by 10 feet. When it's in flight, its passengers are shielded from wind and extreme temperatures as if inside a tiny hut (though without creating an opaque, immobile sphere). In addition, once per day while the carpet of comfort is on the ground, a command word transforms the carpet into an opulent silk tent that, other than its appearance, is equivalent to a secure shelter.","90,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/carpet-of-comfort
Censer of Conjuring Air Elementals,"This 6-inch-wide, perforated metallic vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. The censer must be filled with incense to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an air elemental. If the censer is filled with incense of meditation, it conjures a greater air elemental as if using summon monster VII. If filled with any other incense, it conjures a Large air elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental consumes any normal incense in the censer, or one-fourth of a block of incense of meditation. The censer cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.","90,000 ",13,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/censer-of-conjuring-air-elementals

Stone of Conjuring Earth Elementals,"A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an earth elemental. If there is an unbroken piece of unworked stone of at least Huge size nearby, the stone conjures a Huge earth elemental as if using summon monster VI. If there is no such stone available (for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked stone, or smaller pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental as if using summon monster V. The stone cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.","90,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stone-of-conjuring-earth-elementals
Apparatus of the Crab,"An apparatus of the crab is a metallic magical vehicle. When unoccupied, it appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 Perception check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus's movements and actions. [  (Lever (1d10)) - (Lever Function): 1 - Extend/retract legs and tail; 2 - Uncover/cover forward porthole; 3 - Uncover/cover side portholes; 4 - Extend/retract pincers and feelers; 5 - Snap pincers; 6 - Move forward/backward; 7 - Turn left/right; 8 - Open/close “eyes” with continual flame inside; 9 - Rise/sink in water; 10 - Open/close hatch  ] Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When active, an apparatus of the crab has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; speed 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (—1 size, +11 natural); melee 2 pincers +12 (2d8); CMB +14; CMD 24.","90,000 ",19,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/apparatus-of-the-crab

Mirror of Opposition,"This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day.

"Beads, Prayer (Strand) (Greater)","This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list. [  (Bead of healing) - Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease; (Bead of karma) - Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes; (Bead of summons) - Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.); (Bead of wind walking) - Wearer can cast wind walk.  ]. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking. Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes non-magical.

Runestone of Power (7th),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours.

Banner of Tactical Command,"This brightly colored banner measures 2 feet by 4 feet in size, and is mounted on an 8-foot-long pole of spiraled gold and ivory. When the commander of an army engaged in mass combat displays this banner, the army under her command is treated as knowing one additional tactic. The granted tactic must be selected at the time of the banner’s creation and cannot be changed. The army must be able to see the banner in a given phase of mass combat to receive the bonus; a banner is considered obscured in conditions of darkness, fog, and sandstorms. If the commander is killed or captured, the banner ceases to function, even if it remains visible in the commander’s absence.

It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. ** Crusades: A noble-looking lord's banner of crusades emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design).

Choker of the Beast,"This black iron neckpiece grants an evil wearer a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws.

Good-aligned creatures within 120 feet of the choker of the beast hear distant bellows of unimaginable rage, giving them a –2 penalty on all Perception checks as the sounds distract them. Within 30 feet of the necklace, the sound increases, and all good-aligned creatures must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be shaken while within range. They can attempt another save after 24 hours. If the wearer willingly breaks the choker in half (a full-round action), the ground under his feet ruptures open and consumes him (as the imprisonment spell). The blood of the beast seeps up from the wound in the earth 1d6 rounds after the wielder is consumed. Treat this as a fiendish carnivorous blob that attacks any living creature within sight.

When he does so, a graven image of the weapon appears on the gauntlet’s plates. The wearer can store up to 10 weapons in the gauntlets in this manner. Retrieving a weapon requires the wearer to touch the image of the weapon he wants. Doing so is a swift action. When a weapon is retrieved, it appears in the hands of the wearer and any weapons the wearer had in his hands is stored in the gauntlets. If there is no room in the gauntlet for the weapons the wearer is holding, those weapons are dropped. The gauntlets can only store weapons; other items cannot be placed in the gauntlet.

Amulet of the Planes,"This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color.

Farwatcher,"This exquisite telescope is crafted of brass, ivory, wood, and carefully polished crystal lenses and silver mirrors, and is over 10 feet long. Anyone using a farwatcher must possess at least 5 ranks in Profession (astronomy) in order to use it—the device is simply too complex for anyone with less training to use it properly. An observer using this device gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to discern celestial bodies, as well as a +20 circumstance bonus on any Profession (astronomer) checks made while using it at night. A farwatcher can be used during either the night or day to look at celestial or terrestrial objects, though any object within 1 mile viewed through the telescope is obscured beyond recognition. A farwatcher allows its user to see things through it as though under the effects of true seeing for up to 1 hour per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be expended in minimum increments of 10 minutes each.","120,850 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/farwatcher
Well of the Welcome Respite,"While normally functioning as a standard well of many worlds, this well possesses a command word that supersedes its normal placement-based destination, and it instead opens up onto a single location designated by its maker during the well’s creation (often the creator’s home or a private, warded demiplane). Those finding the well are not immediately aware of this command word unless a spell more powerful than a simple identify spell is used, and the well’s secret destination, whatever it might be, may or may not still be occupied.","122,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/well-of-the-welcome-respite
"Banner, Knight's (C)","A Knight's banner can be displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. The banners depict the heraldic symbols of several fortresses, and each provides different benefits, which are described below. [  C (transmutation aura): Once per day, while this banner is held aloft or planted by someone with the bravery class feature or the Flagbearer feat, all allies of the banner‘s owner gain the benefits of a blessing of fervor spell while the banner is visible. If the banner is defaced or toppled by an enemy force, this effect ends, and the enemy force gains the benefits of this banner for 10 rounds.  ] A banner can be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of the owner.","125,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-knight-s
Helm of Brilliance,"This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20), Ruby: Wall of fire, Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half), Opal: Daylight. The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.","125,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-brilliance
Helm of Electric Radiance,"The helm of electric radiance is similar to a helm of brilliance, except its spells focus on electricity rather than fire. Other aspects of the helm, such as detecting and damaging undead, remain unchanged. The helm has 10 sapphires that can be used for chain lightning, 20 pieces of amber that can be used for lightning bolt, 30 pieces of petrified wood that can be used for shocking sphere (as flaming sphere but dealing electricity damage), and 40 opals that can be used for daylight. In addition, the wearer gains resistance to electricity 30 and his weapons become shocking weapons instead of flaming weapons.","125,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/helm-of-electric-radiance
Runestone of Power (8th),"A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of the 8th level.","128,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/runestone-of-power-1
"Wayfinder, Contingent","This wayfinder is constructed of delicate ivory. Its face constantly reshapes to form a relief of its bearer, and is capable of changing as quickly as two creatures can pass the wayfinder back and forth. The socket in which an ioun stone could normally be placed is instead filled with a permanently fixed gem that functions as a ring of minor spell storing. After wielding this wayfinder for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer as the spell's target, as though it were using the contingency spell. For example, the wielder of a contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds spell in the wayfinder's gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her. Once used in such a manner, the wayfinder requires 1 month to recharge its contingency effect, though a new spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the conditions of the contingency effect are not met within 1 week of when they were assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the spell stored in the gem can't be changed until it has been cast.","132,000 ",11,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-contingent
Wayfinder of Passage,"This wayfinder is an artistic treasure, crafted in gold and set with tiny opals, rubies, diamonds, and sapphires. Three slots on the inner side of the lid can each hold one ioun stone. It sheds light equivalent to the daylight spell on your command. It has the following abilities, each activated by a different command word: [  ** dimension door (once per day); ** feather fall (at will); ** knock (at will); ** resist energy (once per day, energy resistance 20, lasts 24 hours)  ] When the first ioun stone slot is used, the dimension door ability no longer functions. When the second slot is used, feather fall and resist energy are unavailable. When the third slot is used, daylight and knock no longer function.","136,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard/wayfinder-of-passage
"Bottle, Efreeti","This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.","145,000 ",14,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bottle-efreeti
Crown of Heaven,"This slim golden diadem, bejeweled with diamonds and sapphires, grants its wearer fluency in Celestial and allows her to detect evil at will and use tongues once per day, both on command. She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level. A crown, an orb, and a scepter of heaven—collectively known as a regalia of heaven—increase in power when used together. If the wearer of a crown of heaven wields an orb or scepter of heaven, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an aura of menace in a 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a —2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action. If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an orb and scepter of heaven, the crown’s caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus to AC and saves increases to +2. In addition, as a full-round action, the wearer can create an aura of sanctity for as long as she concentrates. This aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as the benefits of a magic circle against evil and a lesser globe of invulnerability. A crown of heaven bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries an orb or scepter of heaven, it gains one additional negative level per object. An evil creature intentionally donning a crown of heaven gains an additional negative level and is affected as bestow curse (DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid gaining these negative levels.","150,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crown-of-heaven
Cage of Captivity,"This miniature cage of golden wire can be used to capture a weakened outsider once per day. The target outsider must be called or otherwise physically present; a cage of captivity has no effect on summoned outsiders. The target also must be unable to take actions continually throughout the entire process, whether cowering, dazed, dying, helpless, stunned, or unconscious. The user can attempt to draw a subdued outsider into the cage of captivity by placing gemstones within and concentrating for 1 minute. These gems must be worth at least 100 gp per Hit Dice of the target. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save—this increases to DC 25 if the user speaks the target's true name—the target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is drawn into the cage, as the minimum containment option of the binding spell. Any creature holding the cage can converse with the trapped outsider. The planar being cannot use any supernatural or spell-like abilities while trapped, but it can still interact with, lie to, and manipulate captors using appropriate skill checks. Anyone holding the cage of captivity may attempt to open it as a standard action. If an outsider is trapped within, doing so requires a DC 22 Will save. If a creature fails this save, they cannot open the cage and are repulsed by it for 24 hours as per the antipathy spell. The user who originally captured the imprisoned outsider gains a +5 morale bonus on this save. Any creature opening a cage of captivity can compel the trapped outsider to perform a service in exchange for its release. The trapped creature is compelled to fulfill this request as geas/quest if the creature opening the cage of captivity knows the creature's true name. If not, this request functions as lesser geas if the trapped outsider has 7 or fewer Hit Dice, or as suggestion if it has more than 7 Hit Dice. These requests ignore any spell resistance of the trapped outsider, but a successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Once it performs this service, an outsider can never again be trapped by the same cage of captivity. Variant cages of captivity may take the form of lamps, bowls, bottles, and similar containers.","160,000 ",15,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cage-of-captivity

Cubic Gate,"This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed. If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time. If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves.","164,000 ",13,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/cubic-gate
Iron Flask,"These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. The command word can be used only once per day. If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following: [  (d%) - (Contents); 01–50 - Empty; 51–54 - Large air elemental; 55–58 - Invisible stalker; 59–62 - Large earth elemental; 63–66 - Xorn; 67–70 - Large fire elemental; 71–74 - Salamander; 75–78 - Large water elemental; 79–82 - Xill; 83–85 - Yeth hound; 86 - Demon (shadow); 87 - Demon (vrock); 88 - Demon (hezrou); 89 - Demon (glabrezu); 90 - Demon (succubus); 91 - Devil (osyluth); 92 - Devil (barbazu); 93 - Devil (erinyes); 94 - Devil (cornugon); 95 - Agathion (avoral); 96 - Azata (ghaele); 97 - Archon (trumpet); 98 - Rakshasa; 99 - Demon (balor); 100 - Devil (pit fiend)  ]","170,000 ",20,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/iron-flask
Mirror of Mental Prowess,"This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. A creature who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows. Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language. View other places as if with clairvoyance, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them. Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror. Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).","175,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mirror-of-mental-prowess
"Banner, Bastion","This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner. Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures). When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects are: [  ** Protection from energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another; ** Cause fear (affects enemies only), and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks; ** Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour; ** Freedom of movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20; ** Invisibility purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons; ** Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons; ** Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves; ** Daylight; all spells with the fire or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level; ** Tongues; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma; ** Dimensional anchor; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC; ** Darkness, and hallow effect is unhallow instead; enemies are sickened  ]","182,000 ",10,Moderate,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/banner-bastion

Mirror of Life Trapping,"This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner. If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (Hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.","200,000 ",17,Strong,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/mirror-of-life-trapping
